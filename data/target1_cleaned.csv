1301148,"Altered thyroid status in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) exposed to co-planar 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl","Recent studies indicate that co-planar 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB) congeners or their metabolites may disrupt thyroid function in fishes. Although co-planar PCB have been detected at microgram per kilogram levels in fish from contaminated areas, few studies have examined mechanisms whereby, co-planar PCBs may alter thyroid function in fish. We treated immature lake trout by intraperitoneal (i.p.)-injection or dietary gavage with vehicle containing 0, 0.7, 1.2, 25 or 40 microg 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) per kgBW. Blood and tissue samples were collected at various times up to 61 weeks following exposure. The treatments produced sustained dose-dependent elevations of tissue (PCB 126) concentrations. Thyroid epithelial cell height (TECH), plasma thyroxine (T4) and 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) concentrations, hepatic 5'-monodeiodinase, hepatic glucuronidation of T4 and T3, as well as plasma T4 kinetics and fish growth were analyzed. Exposure to the highest doses of PCB 126 caused increased TECH, plasma T4 dynamics and T4-glucuronidation (T4-G). PCB 126 did not affect 5'-monodeiodinase and T3-glucuronidation (T3-G) and there were no effects on fish growth or condition. Because T3 status and growth were unaffected, the thyroid system was able to compensate for the alterations caused by the PCB 126 exposure. It is clear that concentrations of co-planar PCBs similar to those found in predatory fish from contaminated areas in the Great Lakes are capable of enhancing metabolism of T4. These changes may be of significance when T4 requirements are high for other reasons (e.g. periods of rapid growth, warm temperatures, metamorphosis, and parr-smolt transformation).",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,6
6969548,Thyroid hormone formation catalyzed by human thyroid peroxidase: a new and physiological measurement of thyroid peroxidase,"This report describes a method for measurement of TPO activity by the amount of thyroid hormone production. Thyroid hormone formation was accomplished by incubating purified iodine-poor Tg with human TPO for 60 min at 37 C in the presence of free DIT, KI, and an H2O2 source. Newly formed T3 and T4 were measured by radioimmunoassay of the Tg hydrolysates. With this method, TPO-catalyzed iodination of Tg and thyroid hormone formation were measured simultaneously from eight normal thyroid glands and 15 thyroid glands from MMI-treated patients with Graves' disease. Graves' disease TPO showed iodinating activity and T4 formation which was higher than that of TPO from normal thyroids, and there was a positive linear correlation between the iodinating activity and the amount of T4 formation. T3 production by highly active TPO, however, dissociates from the amount of T4 formation and the degree of Tg iodination. Thus, if the activity of TPO is to be measured by the amount of thyroid hormone production, T4 should be used rather than T3. The method of thyroid hormone formation described here provides a new and physiological measurement of TPO activity and should be useful for investigation of the role of human TPO in thyroid hormone formation.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
202575,Interactions of halogenated industrial chemicals with transthyretin and effects on thyroid hormone levels in vivo,"Previous results in experimental systems have suggested that hydroxylated PCBs may decrease thyroid hormone levels through associative interaction with transthyretin. In the present paper it was investigated whether this property was also shared by various industrial chemicals, mainly pesticides. In total, 65 compounds from 12 chemical groups were analyzed for direct interference with the T4 binding site of transthyretin using a competitive binding assay. Sixty per cent of the compounds were competitive at a concentration level of 100 microM. Relatively strong interactions were observed by several chlorophenols, chlorophenoxy acids and nitrophenols, as well as by individual compounds such as hexachlorobenzene, dicofol, bromoxynil and tetrachlorohydroquinone. Examples from these chemical groups, e.g. pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid, dinoseb and bromoxynil, also reduced plasma TT4 levels in rats. In addition, bromoxynil decreased plasma TT3 levels. The results suggest the existence of a number of halogenated industrial chemicals with a potential for lowering plasma thyroid hormone levels through interference with hormone transport carriers.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
5082333,An AOP-based alternative testing strategy to predict the impact of thyroid hormone disruption on swim bladder inflation in zebrafish,"The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework can be used to help support the development of alternative testing strategies aimed at predicting adverse outcomes caused by triggering specific toxicity pathways. In this paper, we present a case-study demonstrating the selection of alternative in chemico assays targeting the molecular initiating events of established AOPs, and evaluate use of the resulting data to predict higher level biological endpoints. Based on two AOPs linking inhibition of the deiodinase (DIO) enzymes to impaired posterior swim bladder inflation in fish, we used in chemico enzyme inhibition assays to measure the molecular initiating events for an array of 51 chemicals. Zebrafish embryos were then exposed to 14 compounds with different measured inhibition potentials. Effects on posterior swim bladder inflation, predicted based on the information captured by the AOPs, were evaluated. By linking the two datasets and setting thresholds, we were able to demonstrate that the in chemico dataset can be used to predict biological effects on posterior chamber inflation, with only two outliers out of the 14 tested compounds. Our results show how information organized using the AOP framework can be employed to develop or select alternative assays, and successfully forecast downstream key events along the AOP. In general, such in chemico assays could serve as a first-tier high-throughput system to screen and prioritize chemicals for subsequent acute and chronic fish testing, potentially reducing the need for long-term and costly toxicity tests requiring large numbers of animals.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
6971001,Presence of a soluble inhibitor of thyroid iodination in primary cultures of thyroid cells,"Monolayer cultures of thyroid cells lose their iodide organification capacity a few days before the disappearance of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity. The present studies were performed in order to clarify this point. The above mentioned difference was due to the presence of an inhibitor in the monolayer thyroid cells culture, given that total homogenate prepared from confluent cells caused a significant inhibition of activity of TPO from fresh tissue. The inhibitor was localized in the 105000g supernatant of the homogenate of the cell culture, but not in a similar preparation obtained from fresh thyroid. It is thermostable, dialyzable and has a molecular weight of less than 2 kDa. Addition of the inhibitor at the end of the reaction of tyrosine iodination failed to alter the results. This fact suggests that the compound does not destroy the iodinated product. The presence of the cytosolic inhibitor was observed in monolayer thyroid cell cultures of different species (bovine, porcine, rat and human) but not in free follicles cultures.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Investigating the effect of IgG's from 23 hypothyroid patients on TPO activity inhibition was detected in 15 cases with the guaiacol method. It was found that anti-TPO antibodies exerted a competitive inhibition TPO activity with respect to the substrate guaiacol. The inhibition is carried by IgGF(ab')2 fragment.

6580272,Thyroid hormone deiodinases: physiology and clinical disorders,"Thyroid hormone action is achieved through the binding of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine to its nuclear receptor, which results in alterations in gene expression. An impairment in thyroid hormone action during vertebrate development results in severe, irreversible abnormalities in tissue growth, maturation, and function. The deiodinases are a family of selenoproteins expressed in a number of fetal and adult tissues that catalyze the activation and inactivation of thyroid hormones. Their unique biochemical characteristics and tissue and developmental expression patterns suggest that deiodinases may control the concentration of active thyroid hormone available to specific tissues or cell types at certain stages of development. The deiodinases thus appear to play an important role in regulating thyroid hormone action at a prereceptor level. Current research focusing on a better understanding of the biochemistry, regulation, and physiologic role of these enzymes is the focus of this review.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,6

To determine the frequency and pattern of TPO abnormalities, we have been screening TPO genes of patients with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism._x000D_
_x000D_
Subjects and methods: TPO genes of a patient with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism and her parents were directly sequenced, and two novel missense mutations (R665W and G771R) were found. The former was derived from her father and the latter from her mother. R665 and G771 were well conserved in the peroxidase superfamily. When mRNAs containing each of the mutations were transfected into CHO-K1 cells, each cell showed faint TPO enzyme activity. However, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic analyses revealed that neither of the mutated TPOs reached the plasma membrane._x000D_

Conclusions: Two novel missense mutations in the TPO gene were found. TPO proteins encoded by these mutated alleles showed abnormal cellular localization; namely, localization on the plasma membrane was disturbed. The loss of plasma membrane localization in mutated TPOs brought about the iodide organification defect, which was diagnosed as congenital hypothyroidism.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
6969530,Regulation of type III iodothyronine deiodinase expression in human cell lines,"Type I iodothyronine deiodinase (D1) and type II iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) catalyze the activation of the prohormone T4 to the active hormone T3; type III iodothyronine deiodinase (D3) catalyzes the inactivation of T4 and T3. D3 is highly expressed in brain, placenta, pregnant uterus, and fetal tissues and plays an important role in regulating thyroid hormone bioavailability during fetal development. We examined the activity of the different deiodinases in human cell lines and investigated the regulation of D3 activity and mRNA expression in these cell lines, as well as its possible coexpression with neighboring genes Dlk1 and Dio3os, which may also be especially important during development. D1 activity and mRNA were only found in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells, and D2 activity was observed in none of the cell lines. D3 activity and mRNA was found in ECC-1 endometrium carcinoma cells, MCF-7 mammacarcinoma cells, WRL-68 embryonic liver cells, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, but not in the HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell line or in any choriocarcinoma or astrocytoma cell line. We demonstrated that the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate increased D3 activity 2- to 9-fold in ECC-1, MCF-7, WRL-68, and SH-SY5Y cells. Estradiol increased D3 activity 3-fold in ECC-1, but not in any other cells. Dexamethasone decreased D3 activity in WRL-68 cells only in the absence of fetal calf serum. Incubation with retinoids increased D3 activity 2- to 3-fold in ECC-1, WRL-68, and MCF-7 cells but decreased D3 activity in SH-SY5Y cells. D3 expression in the different cells was not affected by cAMP or thyroid hormone. Interestingly, D3 mRNA expression in the different cell lines strongly correlated with Dio3os mRNA expression and in a large set of neuroblastoma cell lines also with Dlk1 expression. In conclusion, we identified different human D3-expressing cell lines, in which the regulation of D3 expression is cell type-specific. Our data suggest that estradiol may be one of the factors contributing to the induction of D3 activity in the pregnant uterus and that in addition to gene-specific regulatory elements, more distant common regulatory elements also may be involved in the regulation of D3 expression.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

However, to date there have been no detailed studies. Here, we explored the thyroidal effects of dietary peanut seed coats (PSC) in rats. The PSC has high levels of pro-goitrogenic substances including phenolic and other cyanogenic constituents. The PSC was mixed with a standard diet and fed to rats for 30 and 60 days, respectively. Animals fed with the PSC-supplemented diet showed a significant increase in urinary excretion of thiocyanate and iodine, thyroid enlargement, and hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of thyroid follicles. In addition, there was inhibition of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity, 5'-deiodinase-I (DIO1) activity, and (Na+-K+)-ATPase activity in the experimental groups of rats as compared to controls. Furthermore, the PSC fed animals exhibited decreased serum circulating total T4 and T3 levels, severe in the group treated for longer duration.

51694,Predicting neonatal perchlorate dose and inhibition of iodide uptake in the rat during lactation using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling,"Perchlorate (ClO4-), a contaminant in drinking water, competitively inhibits active uptake of iodide (I-) into various tissues, including mammary tissue. During postnatal development, inhibition of I- uptake in the mammary gland and neonatal thyroid and the active concentration ClO4- in milk indicate a potentially increased susceptibility of neonates to endocrine disruption. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to reproduce measured ClO4- distribution in the lactating and neonatal rat and predict resulting effects on I- kinetics from competitive inhibition at the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). Kinetic I- and ClO4- behavior in tissues with NIS (thyroid, stomach, mammary gland, and skin) was simulated with multiple subcompartments, Michaelis-Menten (M-M) kinetics and competitive inhibition. Physiological and kinetic parameters were obtained from literature and experiment. Systemic clearance and M-M parameters were estimated by fitting simulations to tissue and serum data. The model successfully describes maternal and neonatal thyroid, stomach, skin, and plasma, as well as maternal mammary gland and milk data after ClO4- exposure (from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg-day ClO4-) and acute radioiodide (2.1 to 33,000 ng/kg I-) dosing. The model also predicts I- uptake inhibition in the maternal thyroid, mammary gland, and milk. Model simulations predict a significant transfer of ClO4- through milk after maternal exposure; approximately 50% to 6% of the daily maternal dose at doses ranging from 0.01 to 10.0 mg ClO4-/kg-day, respectively. Comparison of predicted dosimetrics across life-stages in the rat indicates that neonatal thyroid I- uptake inhibition is similar to the adult and approximately tenfold less than the fetus.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,6
6969528,Regulation of type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase expression in cultured rat astrocytes: role of the Erk cascade,"The type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (D3) metabolizes thyroid hormones to inactive metabolites in many tissues, including the brain. In the present studies, we have examined the mechanisms by which T3 (T3), retinoic acid, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) induce D3 expression in primary cultures of neonatal rat astrocytes. In untreated cells, D3 messenger RNA (mRNA) was essentially undetectable by Northern analysis and RT-PCR. However, all four agents induced expression of a 2.4-kb D3 transcript as well as D3 activity. Induction of D3 by TPA and bFGF was more rapid than that by T3 and retinoic acid, and T3 potentiated the stimulatory effects of TPA and bFGF. D3 induction by TPA was blocked by GF 109203X, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. In addition, the effects of TPA and bFGF were partially prevented by PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK and the Erk signaling cascade. These studies demonstrate that multiple growth factors and hormones regulate D3 activity in cultured astrocytes by inducing D3 mRNA expression. In addition, the stimulatory effects of TPA and bFGF on D3 mRNA and activity appear to be mediated at least in part by activation of the MEK/Erk signaling cascade.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Zebrafish embryos were exposed to progesterone (P4) or norgestrel (NGT) at 5, 50 and 100 ng L(-1) for 144 h post fertilization (hpf), and the transcriptional levels of target genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis were determined daily. The results showed that P4 had only minor effects on the mRNA expression of thyroglobulin (Tg), iodothyronine deiodinase type Œô (Dio1) and thyroid hormone receptor Œ≤ (Thrb) genes. Similarly, the effects of NGT on transcripts of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Trh), Dio1, iodothyronine deiodinase type II (Dio2) and thyroid hormone receptor Œ± (Thra) genes were generally low. In addition, NGT resulted in some alterations of Tg and Thrb transcripts at different time points. However, a strong induction of Nis mRNA by P4 and NGT was observed in zebrafish embryos-larvae. The overall results showed that besides Nis no effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis are observed following exposure to P4 and NGT, which imply that both P4 and NGT have potential effects on the thyroid endocrine system by inducing transcript of Nis gene during the early stage of zebrafish.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
6969525,Ascidian homologs of mammalian thyroid peroxidase genes are expressed in the thyroid-equivalent region of the endostyle,"The endostyle is a pharyngeal organ for the internal filter feeding of urochordates, cephalochordates, and larval lamprey. This organ is also considered to be homologous to the follicular thyroid gland of higher vertebrates. Thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) are specifically expressed in the thyroid gland of higher vertebrates, and they play an important role in iodine metabolism for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Previous histochemical observations showed that iodine-concentrating and peroxidase activities were detected in zones 7, 8, and 9 of the ascidian endostyle, suggesting that these zones contains cells that are equivalent to those in the vertebrate follicular thyroid. In order to investigate the molecular developmental mechanisms involved in the formation and function of the endostyle, with special reference to the evolution of the thyroid gland, in the present study, we isolated and characterized cDNA clones for TPO genes, CiTPO from Ciona intestinalis and HrTPO from Halocynthia roretzi. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the expression of the ascidian TPO genes was restricted to zone 7, one of the elements equivalent to the thyroid. These results provide the first evidence at the gene expression level for shared function between a part of the ascidian endostyle and the vertebrate follicular thyroid gland. J. Exp. Zool. ( Mol.

In the present study we used thyroid histoautoradiography, an indirect assay of in vivo TPO activity, to determine the possible parallelism between the in vitro and in vivo changes induced by experimental DM. DM was induced in male Wistar rats (about 250 g body weight) by a single i.p. streptozotocin injection (45 mg/kg), while control (C) animals received a single injection of the vehicle. Seven and 30 days after diabetes induction, each diabetic and control animal was given i.p. a tracer dose of 125I (2 microCi), 2.5 h before thyroid excision. The glands were counted, weighted, fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin and cut. The sections were stained with HE and exposed to NTB-2 emulsion (Kodak). The autohistograms were developed and the quantitative distribution of silver grains was evaluated with a computerized image analyzer system. Thyroid radioiodine uptake was significantly decreased only after 30 days of DM (C: 0.38 +/- 0.05 vs DM: 0.20 +/- 0.04%/mg thyroid, P < 0.05) while in vivo TPO activity was significantly decreased 7 and 30 days after DM induction (C: 5.3 and 4.5 grains/100 micron 2 vs DM: 2.9 and 1.6 grains/100 micron 2, respectively, P < 0.05).

51568,PBPK predictions of perchlorate distribution and its effect on thyroid uptake of radioiodide in the male rat,"Due to perchlorate's (ClO4-) ability to competitively inhibit thyroid iodide (I-) uptake through the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), potential human health risks exist from chronic exposure via drinking water. Such risks may include hypothyroidism, goiter, and mental retardation (if exposure occurs during critical periods in neurodevelopment). To aid in predicting perchlorate's effect on normal I- kinetics, we developed a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for the adult male rat. The model structure describes simultaneous kinetics for both anions together with their interaction at the NIS, in particular, the inhibition of I- uptake by ClO4-. Subcompartments and Michaelis-Menten (M-M) kinetics were used to describe active uptake of both anions in the thyroid, stomach, and skin. Separate compartments for kidney, liver, plasma, and fat were described by passive diffusion. The model successfully predicts both 36ClO4- and 125I- kinetics after iv doses of 3.3 mg/kg and 33 mg/kg, respectively, as well as inhibition of thyroid 125I- uptake by ClO4- after iv doses of ClO4- (0.01 to 3.0 mg/kg). The model also predicts serum and thyroid ClO4- concentrations from 14-day drinking water exposures (0.01 to 30.0 mg ClO4-/kg/day) and compensation of perchlorate-induced inhibition of radioiodide uptake due to upregulation of the thyroid. The model can be used to extrapolate dose metrics and correlate observed effects in perchlorate toxicity studies to other species and life stages, such as rat gestation (Clewell et al., 2003). Because the model successfully predicts perchlorate's interaction with iodide, it provides a sound basis for future incorporation of the complex hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback system.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,6

Turtles exposed to low ambient temperature (10 degrees C for 15 days) showed a significant decrease in relative thyroid weight, follicular cell size (cell became squamous from cuboidal type) and epithelial height in both the peripheral and central follicles of the gland, with the appearance of homogeneous colloid materials in the follicular lumen. Thyroid peroxidase activity declined significantly. In contrast, high ambient temperatures (32/34 degrees C for 15 days) caused reverse changes to those observed after exposure with low ambient temperature. No significant difference was marked in thyroid activity between 32 and 34 degrees C temperature treatments. The findings provide evidence that low ambient temperature inhibits thyroid activity and high ambient temperature stimulates the gland activity in soft-shelled turtles.

The structure-activity relationships of 44 halogenated compounds for IYD-inhibitory activity were examined in vitro using microsomes of HEK-293 T cells expressing recombinant human IYD. The compounds examined were 17 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 15 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), two agrichemicals, five antiparasitics, two pharmaceuticals and three food colorants. Among them, 25 halogenated phenolic compounds inhibited IYD activity at the concentration of 1√ó10(-4)M or 6√ó10(-4)M.

6974859,Effect of aging on thyroidal and pituitary T4-5'-deiodinase activity in female rats,"Some alterations in hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis occur during aging. In this study we evaluated the changes induced by aging in pituitary and thyroid iodothyronine-deiodinase (DI) activities, and in serum T4, T3 and TSH. Groups of 6-18 female Dutch-Miranda rats aged 3-5 months (young adults) were studied in parallel with similar groups of old (10-12 months) and senescent (24-30 months) animals. DI activities were determined in the microsomal fraction of pooled pituitary or thyroid glands (6 glands per pool), using T4 as substrate and DTT as cofactor; the T3 formed was measured by specific radioimmunoassay. Serum T3, T4 and TSH were measured by specific radioimmunoassays. Serum T4 was significantly decreased in both groups of aged rats, but serum TSH was unaffected. Serum T3 was just slightly decreased in the senescent rats. Total pituitary DI activity was significantly decreased in the aged rats (10-12 and 24-30 months). Both type I and type II DI activities were affected, although the decrease in type I DI only became significant in the senescent rats. In contrast, to its effect in the pituitary, aging does not decrease, even slightly, the DI activity in the thyroid gland. The thyroid DI activity may contribute to the unaltered serum T3 levels found in aged rats in the present study.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

To examine whether widely used brominated flame retardants and pesticides affect TR-mediated gene expression, those with organohalogen, which is also present in T3, were screened. To monitor the TR-mediated gene expression, HeLaTR cells were transfected with a luciferase gene that was linked to the thyroid hormone responsive element. Thus, transcription of the luciferase gene in HeLaTR cells is driven by TR. By screening 38 chemical agents, it was found that 4,4'-diiodobiphenyl (DIB), markedly, and 1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and nitrofen (NIP), to a much lesser extent but significantly, enhanced the expression of the luciferase gene at concentrations that did not affect the growth of HeLaTR cells. DIB also augmented the E2-induced expression of the luciferase gene that was linked to the estrogen responsive element in MCF7 cells, whereas HBCD and NIP did not. These results indicate that DIB augments TR- and ER-mediated gene expression, but HBCD and NIP affect only TR-mediated gene expression.

Since the molecular target of these compounds is thought to be thyroid peroxidase (TPO) which catalyzes the transfer of iodine to thyroglobulin, we examined the effect of these compounds on peroxidative activity in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the human TPO gene. The activity was inhibited by 50 microM ETU, 5 microM ziram and 5 microM zineb, the last-mentioned effect being irreversible in the absence of iodide. Thiram had no effect. By contrast, the iodinating activity of TPO was blocked only by 5 microM ETU and 50 microM zineb but not by the other compounds.

1412487,The ultraviolet filter benzophenone 2 interferes with the thyroid hormone axis in rats and is a potent in vitro inhibitor of human recombinant thyroid peroxidase,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), either plant constituents or contaminants deriving from industrial products, may interfere with the thyroid hormone (TH) axis. Here, we examined whether selected EDCs inhibit the key reactions of TH biosynthesis catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase (TPO). We used a novel in vitro assay based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into the human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC-238. F21388 (synthetic flavonoid), bisphenol A (building block for polycarbonates), and the UV filter benzophenone 2 (BP2) inhibited hrTPO. BP2 is contained in numerous cosmetics of daily use and may be in regular contact with human skin. Half-maximal inhibition in the guaiacol assay occurred at 450 nmol/liter BP2, a concentration 20- and 200-fold lower than those required in case of the TPO-inhibiting antithyroid drugs methimazole and propylthiouracil, respectively. BP2 at 300 nmol/liter combined with the TPO substrate H(2)O(2) (10 mumol/liter) inactivated hrTPO; this was, however, prevented by micromolar amounts of iodide. BP2 did not inhibit iodide uptake into FRTL-5 cells. In BP2-treated rats (333 and 1000 mg/kg body weight), serum total T(4) was significantly decreased and serum thyrotropin was significantly increased. TPO activities in the thyroids of treated animals were unchanged, a finding also described for methimazole and propylthiouracil. Thus, EDCs, most potently BP2, may disturb TH homeostasis by inhibiting or inactivating TPO, effects that are even more pronounced in the absence of iodide.

The present study examines the ability of PFOS to disturb thyroid function and the possible mechanisms involved in PFOS-induced thyroid hormone alteration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 1.7, 5.0, and 15.0 mg/L of PFOS in drinking water for 91 consecutive days. Serum was collected for analysis of total and free thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotrophin (TSH). Thyroid and liver were removed for the measurement of endpoints closely related to thyroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism following PFOS exposure. Determined endpoints were the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for two isoforms of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (UGT1A6 and UGT1A1) and type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) in liver, sodium iodide symporter (NIS), TSH receptor (TSHR), and DIO1 in thyroid as well as the activity of thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Serum total T4 level decreased significantly at all applied dosages, whereas total T3 level increased markedly only at 1.7 mg/L of PFOS. No statistically significant toxic effects of PFOS on serum TSH were observed. Hepatic UGTIA1, but not UGT1A6, mRNA was up-regulated at 5.0 and 15.0 mg/L of PFOS. Treatment with PFOS lowered hepatic DIO1 mRNA at 15.0 mg/L but increased thyroidal DIO1 mRNA dose dependently. The activity of TPO, NIS, and TSHR mRNA in thyroid were unaffected by PFOS treatment. These results indicate that increased hepatic T4 glucuronidation via UGT1A1 and increased thyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 via DIO1 were responsible in part for PFOS-induced hypothyroxinemia in rats.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
757602,Interspecies differences in susceptibility to perturbation of thyroid homeostasis: a case study with perchlorate,"Despite many physiological similarities, humans and rats exhibit notably different susceptibilities to thyroid perturbation. Considerable research has recently been conducted on the thyroid-active chemical perchlorate, a chemical of emerging environmental and regulatory interest. While the data indicate humans and rats exhibit similar dose-response relationships in terms of acute inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake, the two species appear to exhibit notable differences in terms of thyroid hormone response, the toxicologically significant consequence of iodide uptake inhibition. We analyzed dose-response data for changes in serum T(3), T(4), and TSH levels from studies in humans, rats, mice, and rabbits. We found that thyroid homeostasis in the rat appears to be strikingly more sensitive to perchlorate than any of the other species. Rats exhibited an increase in serum TSH at 0.1mg/kg-day whereas other species remained unresponsive even at doses of 10mg/kg-day. Less pronounced but consistent effects were seen with serum T(3) and T(4). These cross-species comparisons provide strong evidence that data obtained from rat studies should be critically evaluated for their relevance to humans. If rat data are used to develop toxicity criteria for perchlorate, we propose that this is an instance where an inter-species uncertainty factor less than one is supportable.

757341,Metamorphic inhibition of Xenopus laevis by sodium perchlorate: effects on development and thyroid histology,"The perchlorate anion inhibits thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis via inhibition of the sodium-iodide symporter. It is, therefore, a good model chemical to aid in the development of a bioassay to screen chemicals for affects on thyroid function. Xenopus laevis larvae were exposed to sodium perchlorate during metamorphosis, a period of TH-dependent development, in two experiments. In the first experiment, stage 51 and 54 larvae were exposed for 14 d to 16, 63, 250, 1,000, and 4,000 microg perchlorate/ L. In the second experiment, stage 51 larvae were exposed throughout metamorphosis to 8, 16, 32, 63, and 125 microg perchlorate/L. Metamorphic development and thyroid histology were the primary endpoints examined. Metamorphosis was retarded significantly in the first study at concentrations of 250 microg/L and higher, but histological effects were observed at 16 microg/L. In the second study, metamorphosis was delayed by 125 microg/L and thyroid size was increased significantly at 63 microg/L. These studies demonstrate that inhibition of metamorphosis readily can be detected using an abbreviated protocol. However, thyroid gland effects occur at concentrations below those required to elicit developmental delay, demonstrating the sensitivity of this endpoint and suggesting that thyroidal compensation is sufficient to promote normal development until perchlorate reaches critical concentrations.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

Serum TH binding proteins play a major role for the availability of TH since only free hormone concentrations may dictate cellular uptake. One of these proteins, transthyretin is also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after being secreted by the choroid plexus. Entry routes into the brain like the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and the blood-CSF-barrier will be explicated regarding fetal and adult status. Recently identified TH transmembrane transporters (THTT) like monocarboxylate transporter 8 (Mct8) play a major role in uptake of TH across the BBB but as well in transport between cells like astrocytes and neurons within the brain.

The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of the specific TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8 (SLC16A2)), MCT10, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1 (SLCO1C1)), and the types 2 and 3 deiodinases (D2 and D3) in the developing human hypothalamus.<br /><br /><strong>DESIGN: </strong>Fifteen postmortem brain samples of fetuses and young children ranging between 17 weeks of gestation and 29 months of postnatal age including one child (28 months) with central congenital hypothyroidism were studied.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Sections of the different hypothalami were stained with polyclonal rabbit antisera against MCT8, MCT10, OATP1C1, D2, and D3.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>We found MCT8 and D3 but not D2 protein expression to be present in our earliest sample of 17 weeks of gestation, indicating triiodothyronine degradation, but not production at this time of development. At term, expression of TH transporters and D2 decreased and D3 expression increased, suggesting decreased TH signaling just before birth. The child with central congenital hypothyroidism showed higher MCT8 and D2 expression compared with the other children of similar age.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>This study reports the developmental timing of expression of components crucial for central TH signaling in the human hypothalamus.

This alteration causes reduced neonatal viability, growth retardation, and central hypothyroidism. Here we examined how these phenotypes are affected by a deficiency in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), which is a major contributor to the transport of the active thyroid hormone, T3, into the cell. MCT8 deficiency eliminated the neonatal lethality of type 3 deiodinase (D3)-deficient mice and significantly ameliorated their growth retardation. Double-mutant newborn mice exhibited similar peripheral thyrotoxicosis and increased brain expression of T3-dependent genes as mice with D3 deficiency only. Later in neonatal life and adulthood, double-mutant mice manifested central and peripheral TH status similar to mice with single MCT8 deficiency, with low serum T4, elevated serum TSH and T3, and decreased T3-dependent gene expression in the hypothalamus. In double-mutant adult mice, both thyroid gland size and the hypothyroidism-induced rise in TSH were greater than those in mice with single D3 deficiency but less than those in mice with MCT8 deficiency alone. Our results demonstrate that the marked phenotypic abnormalities observed in the D3-deficient mouse, including perinatal mortality, growth retardation, and central hypothyroidism in adult animals, require expression of MCT8, confirming the interdependent relationship between the TH transport into cells and the deiodination processes.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Purified porcine thyroglobulin or bovine serum albumin as acceptor protein was iodinated with [125I]NaI and H2O2 by purified porcine TPO. Iodinated protein was separated by acid precipitation on membrane filter or paper chromatography. Both CH3HgCl and HgCl2 dose-dependently inhibited the iodination, but HgCl2 was more potent to inhibit the iodination than CH3HgCl.

Mct8 (monocarboxylate transporter 8), expressed predominantly in the brain and placenta, mediates thyroid hormone uptake from the circulation and is required for normal neural development. RA induces differentiation of F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells toward neurons as well as extraembryonal endoderm. We hypothesized that Mct8 is functionally expressed in F9 cells and induced by RA. All-trans-RA (tRA) and other RA receptor (RAR) agonists dramatically (>300-fold) induced Mct8. tRA treatment significantly increased uptake of triiodothyronine and thyroxine (4.1- and 4.3-fold, respectively), which was abolished by a selective Mct8 inhibitor, bromosulfophthalein. Sequence inspection of the Mct8 promoter region and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR analysis in F9 cells identified 11 transcription start sites and a proximal Sp1 site but no TATA box. tRA significantly enhanced Mct8 promoter activity through a consensus RA-responsive element located 6.6 kilobases upstream of the coding region. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated binding of RAR and retinoid X receptor to the RA response element. The promotion of thyroid hormone uptake through the transcriptional up-regulation of Mct8 by RAR is likely to be important for extraembryonic endoderm development and neural differentiation.

7375810,"Transport, Metabolism, and Function of Thyroid Hormones in the Developing Mammalian Brain","Ever since the discovery of thyroid hormone deficiency as the primary cause of cretinism in the second half of the 19th century, the crucial role of thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in embryonic brain development has been established. However, the biological understanding of TH function in brain formation is far from complete, despite advances in treating thyroid function deficiency disorders. The pleiotropic nature of TH action makes it difficult to identify and study discrete roles of TH in various aspect of embryogenesis, including neurogenesis and brain maturation. These challenges notwithstanding, enormous progress has been achieved in understanding TH production and its regulation, their conversions and routes of entry into the developing mammalian brain. The endocrine environment has to adjust when an embryo ceases to rely solely on maternal source of hormones as its own thyroid gland develops and starts to produce endogenous TH. A number of mechanisms are in place to secure the proper delivery and action of TH with placenta, blood-brain interface, and choroid plexus as barriers of entry that need to selectively transport and modify these hormones thus controlling their active levels. Additionally, target cells also possess mechanisms to import, modify and bind TH to further fine-tune their action. A complex picture of a tightly regulated network of transport proteins, modifying enzymes, and receptors has emerged from the past studies. TH have been implicated in multiple processes related to brain formation in mammals-neuronal progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, functional maturation, and survival-with their exact roles changing over developmental time. Given the plethora of effects thyroid hormones exert on various cell types at different developmental periods, the precise spatiotemporal regulation of their action is of crucial importance. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about TH delivery, conversions, and function in the developing mammalian brain.

Recent studies identified the DIO2 gene encoding type 2 deiodinase (D2) as a susceptibility locus for OA, and further data suggest deiodinase-regulated local availability of triiodothyronine (T3) in the joint plays an important role in cartilage maintenance and repair. To investigate the hypothesis that reduced tissue T3 availability protects joints from development of OA, the joint phenotypes of adult mice lacking D2 (D2KO) or lacking both D1 and D2 (D1D2KO), the only enzymes that catalyze conversion of the prohormone thyroxine to active T3, were determined._x000D_

No further studies have been found in this context. Thus, the results show that the phenolic and the alkaloidal extracts with the three molecules are potent inhibitors of horseradish peroxidase. Uric acid is used as a substrate reaction to finding the enzymatic inhibition for the first time. The results show that the best inhibitor is hispidin with a value of IC50 = 23 ¬µg/ml. Moreover, Molecular docking has been carried out using the AutoDock Vina program to discuss the nature of interactions and the mechanism of inhibition between both peroxidases (horseradish and thyroid) which is performed with and without heme group for the first time.

Although epidemiologic studies suggest the contribution of TH to the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), the role of DIO2 in CRC remains elusive. Here we show that Dio2 is highly expressed in intestinal polyps of ApcŒî716 mice, a mouse model of familial adenomatous polyposis and early stage sporadic CRC. Laser capture microdissection and in situ hybridization analysis show almost exclusive expression of Dio2 in the stroma of ApcŒî716 polyps in the proximity of the COX-2-positive areas. Treatment with iopanoic acid, a deiodinase inhibitor, or chemical thyroidectomy suppresses tumor formation in ApcŒî716 mice, accompanied by reduced tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Dio2 expression in ApcŒî716 polyps is strongly suppressed by treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam.

This mixture, or various combinations of the components, was also evaluated in a transient transfection system using GH3 cells.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The mixture reduced serum TH levels in pregnant rats on G16 but simultaneously up-regulated the expression of malic enzyme in liver. It also functioned as a TR agonist in vitro; however, none of the individual PCB congeners comprising this mixture were active in this system. Using the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonist alpha-naphthoflavone, and the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1 antagonist ellipticine, we show that the effect of the mixture on the thyroid hormone response element required AhR and CYP1A1.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>We propose that PCB 126 induces CYP1A1 through the AhR in GH3 cells, and that CYP1A1 activates PCB 105 and/or 118 to a form a compound that acts as a TR agonist. These data suggest that some tissues may be especially vulnerable to PCBs interfering directly with TH signaling due to their capacity to express CYP1A1 in response to coplanar PCBs (or other dioxin-like molecules) if sufficient mono-ortho PCBs are present.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,6
7266432,Overexpression of type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase reduces cone death in the leber congenital amaurosis model mice,"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a devastating pediatric retinal degenerative disease, accounting for 20% of blindness in children attending schools for the blind. Mutations in the RPE65 gene, which encodes the retinal pigment epithelium-specific isomerohydrolase RPE65, account for 16% of all LCA cases. Recent findings have linked cone photoreceptor viability to thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. TH signaling regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. At the cellular level, TH action is regulated by the two iodothyronine deiodinases, DIO2 and DIO3. DIO2 converts the prohormone thyroxine (T4) to the bioactive hormone triiodothyronine (T3), and DIO3 inactivates T3 and T4. The present work investigates the effects of overexpression of DIO3 to suppress TH signaling and thereby modulate cone death/survival. Subretinal delivery of AAV5-IRBP/GNAT2-hDIO3 induced robust expression of DIO3 in the mouse retina and significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the cone-dominant LCA model Rpe65 -/- /Nrl -/- mice. Our work shows that suppressing TH signaling by overexpression of DIO3 preserves cones, supporting that suppressing TH signaling locally in the retina may represent a treatment strategy for LCA management.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
6974864,Fasting-induced increase in type II iodothyronine deiodinase activity and messenger ribonucleic acid levels is not reversed by thyroxine in the rat hypothalamus,"The importance of local formation of T3 in the feedback effect of the thyroid gland on hypothalamic TRH-producing cells has been established. Primary failure of the thyroid gland results in a fall in circulating T4 and T3 levels, leading to an elevation in the production and release of TRH in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. In contrast, during short term fasting, declining plasma levels of thyroid hormones coincide with suppressed TRH production and release. In the brain, the prevalent enzyme that converts T4 to T3 is type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DII). The present study was undertaken to determine whether a differential hypothalamic expression of type II deiodinase may exist in fasted rats and in animals that are hypothyroid due to the failure of the thyroid gland. Using in situ hybridization, we assessed type II deiodinase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the hypothalamus of rats that were control euthyroid, hyperthyroid (T4), hypothyroid induced by propylthiouracil (PTU), and fasted. A group of fasted rats also received exogenous T4. DII mRNA was detected around the third ventricle, including the ependymal layer and adjacent periventricular regions as well as in the arcuate nucleus and the external layer of the median eminence. Quantitative in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that PTU treatment and short term fasting resulted in significant elevations in DII messenger levels compared with those in euthyroid controls. Three weeks of PTU administration induced a consistent decline in circulating T3 and undetectable T4 levels, whereas 3 days of fasting resulted in only a 50% fall in the concentration of serum thyroid hormones. Interestingly, however, the expression of the DII mRNA was more than 2-fold higher in fasted animals compared with the values in PTU-treated rats. Furthermore, although T4 administration repressed DII mRNA expression in euthyroid animals, the same treatment had no effect on the fasting-induced elevations of DII message. To assess whether DII enzymatic activity is also affected during food deprivation, hypothalami were dissected out, and DII activity was measured in control euthyroid, fasted, and fasted plus T4-treated rats. To determine whether comparable changes in plasma thyroid hormone levels induced by fasting and PTU treatment could have affected DII enzymatic activity in a similar manner, animals were injected ip with PTU for 5 days to decrease plasma thyroid hormones to levels similar to those caused by fasting. DII enzymatic assay showed a significant increase in DII activity in fasted and fasted plus T4-treated animals compared with those in euthyroid controls and PTU-treated rats. No significant changes were found in PTU-treated rats compared with euthyroid animals. These data indicate that during short term fasting, a signal of nonthyroid origin underlies the robust elevation of DII production and activity in the hypothalamus. Thus, we propose that during the initial phase of food deprivation, an increased negative thyroid feedback exists on the hypothalamus due to locally formed T3. This local hyperthyroidism may, in turn, induce the suppression of TRH under these conditions.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
6974861,Targeted disruption of the type 1 selenodeiodinase gene (Dio1) results in marked changes in thyroid hormone economy in mice,"The type 1 deiodinase (D1) is thought to be an important source of T3 in the euthyroid state. To explore the role of the D1 in thyroid hormone economy, a D1-deficient mouse (D1KO) was made by targeted disruption of the Dio1 gene. The general health and reproductive capacity of the D1KO mouse were seemingly unimpaired. In serum, levels of T4 and rT3 were elevated, whereas those of TSH and T3 were unchanged, as were several indices of peripheral thyroid status. It thus appears that the D1 is not essential for the maintenance of a normal serum T3 level in euthyroid mice. However, D1 deficiency resulted in marked changes in the metabolism and excretion of iodothyronines. Fecal excretion of endogenous iodothyronines was greatly increased. Furthermore, when compared with both wild-type and D2-deficient mice, fecal excretion of [125I]iodothyronines was greatly increased in D1KO mice during the 48 h after injection of [125I]T4 or [125I]T3, whereas urinary excretion of [125I]iodide was markedly diminished. From these data it was estimated that a majority of the iodide generated by the D1 was derived from substrates other than T4. Treatment with T3 resulted in a significantly higher serum T3 level and a greater degree of hyperthyroidism in D1KO mice than in wild-type mice. We conclude that, although the D1 is of questionable importance to the wellbeing of the euthyroid mouse, it may play a major role in limiting the detrimental effects of conditions that alter normal thyroid function, including hyperthyroidism and iodine deficiency.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,6
6969523,Expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase in human osteoblast is stimulated by thyrotropin,"Thyroid hormones play important roles in bone growth, development, and turnover. To exert its biological activity, T(4) needs to be converted to T(3) by iodothyronine deiodinase. In human thyroid gland as well as rat brown adipose tissue, type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) expression is regulated by a TSH receptor-cAMP-mediated mechanism. TSH receptor knockout mice demonstrated the direct effects of TSH on bone via TSH receptors found on osteoblast and osteoclast precursors. In the present study we investigated the possible expression and function of iodothyronine deiodinase and TSH receptors in human osteoblast-like osteosarcoma (SaOS-2) cells and normal human osteoblast (NHOst) cells. Iodothyronine deiodinase activity was detected in SaOS-2 cells and NHOst cells, and all of the characteristics of deiodinating activity were compatible with those of D2. Northern analysis demonstrated D2 mRNA expression in SaOS-2 cells and NHOst cells. D2 mRNA levels as well as D2 activities were rapidly increased by dibutyryl cAMP or forskolin in SaOS-2 cells and NHOst cells. TSH receptor mRNA was demonstrated in SaOS-2 cells and NHOst cells, and D2 mRNA and D2 activity were stimulated by TSH in both cells. In addition, all T(3) receptor isoforms were detected by RT-PCR in SaOS-2 cells and NHOst cells.

6974860,Type 3 deiodinase is critical for the maturation and function of the thyroid axis,"Developmental exposure to appropriate levels of thyroid hormones (THs) in a timely manner is critical to normal development in vertebrates. Among the factors potentially affecting perinatal exposure of tissues to THs is type 3 deiodinase (D3). This enzyme degrades THs and is highly expressed in the pregnant uterus, placenta, and fetal and neonatal tissues. To determine the physiological role of D3, we have generated a mouse D3 knockout model (D3KO) by a targeted inactivating mutation of the Dio3 gene in mouse ES cells. Early in life, D3KO mice exhibit delayed 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) clearance, a markedly elevated serum T3 level, and overexpression of T3-inducible genes in the brain. From postnatal day 15 to adulthood, D3KO mice demonstrate central hypothyroidism, with low serum levels of 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (T4) and T3, and modest or no increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration. Peripheral tissues are also hypothyroid. Hypothalamic T3 content is decreased while thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) expression is elevated. Our results demonstrate that the lack of D3 function results in neonatal thyrotoxicosis followed later by central hypothyroidism that persists throughout life. These mice provide a new model of central hypothyroidism and reveal a critical role for D3 in the maturation and function of the thyroid axis.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7375811,Regulators of thyroid hormone availability and action in embryonic chicken brain development,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are crucial elements in vertebrate brain development. They exert their action mainly through binding of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) to nuclear receptors that directly influence the expression of TH-regulated genes. Intracellular TH action is therefore dependent on both the availability of T3 and its receptors. TH uptake in cells is regulated by specific TH transporters and local activation and inactivation is regulated by deiodinases. This review provides an overview of the general expression pattern of TH transporters, deiodinases and receptors during embryonic chicken brain development and compares it to the situation in mammals. It is clear that THs and their regulators are present in the embryonic brain from the early stages of development, long before the onset of embryonic thyroid gland functioning. The mechanism of TH uptake across the brain barriers during development is only partly understood. At the developing blood-brain-barrier expression of the TH-activating type 2 deiodinase is closely associated with the blood vessels, but contrary to the situation in (adult) mammals no expression of MCT8 or OATP1C1 TH transporters is found at that level in the developing chicken. At the blood-cerebrospinal fluid-barrier co-expression of the TH-inactivating type 3 deiodinase and MCT8 and OATP1C1 is found in birds and mammals.

1936559,Cross-species analysis of thyroperoxidase inhibition by xenobiotics demonstrates conservation of response between pig and rat,"Thyroperoxidase (TPO), the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of thyroid hormone, is a known target for thyroid-disrupting chemicals. In vivo toxicological evidence supporting TPO-inhibition as one molecular-initiating event that leads to thyroid disruption is derived largely from rat models; however, a significant fraction of research on the inhibition of TPO by xenobiotics has been conducted using porcine TPO. The current work tested the hypothesis that porcine and rat thyroid microsomes exposed to TPO-inhibiting chemicals would demonstrate different responses in a guaiacol oxidation assay. A primary objective of this work is to establish the degree of concordance between rat and porcine TPO inhibition data. Microsomes were isolated from both rat and pig thyroid glands, and the guaiacol oxidation assay was performed for a training set of 12 chemicals, including previously reported TPO inhibitors, thyroid-disrupting chemicals thought to perturb other targets, and several previously untested chemicals, to determine the relative TPO inhibition responses across species. Concentration-response curves were derived for methimazole (MMI), dibutylphthalate (DBP), diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), diethylphthalate (DEP), 3,5-dimethylpyrazole-1-methanol (DPM), iopanoic acid (IOA), 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), sodium perchlorate (PERC), p-nonylphenol (PNP), 4-propoxyphenol (4POP), 6-propylthiouracil (PTU), and triclosan (TCS). MMI, PTU, MBT, DPM, 4POP, and at extremely high concentrations, PERC, inhibited TPO activity. Results demonstrated a strong qualitative concordance of response between the two species. All chemicals that inhibited TPO in porcine microsomes also inhibited TPO in rat microsomes. Hill model-derived IC50 values revealed approximate 1.5- to 50-fold differences in relative potency to MMI between species for positive chemicals. DPM, MBT, 4POP, and PTU exhibited greater relative potency to MMI using rat TPO versus porcine TPO, but rank order potency for inhibition was similar for the other test chemicals, with: PTU&gt;MBT&gt;DPM&gt;4POP&gt;PERC for rat TPO and MBT&gt;PTU&gt;DPM&gt;4POP&gt;PERC for porcine TPO.

5215092,Inhibition of thyroid NADPH-oxidase by 2-iodohexadecanal in a cell-free system,"The major nonpolar iodolipid formed in horse thyroid cells has recently been identified as 2-iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA). We have investigated in vitro the effect of 2-IHDA on the NADPH-oxidase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activities of a porcine thyroid plasma membrane preparation. 2-IHDA inhibited NADPH-oxidase activity, with half-inhibition at 3-5 microM, but it had no effect on NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. It inhibited the TPO-catalyzed iodination of protein, but not iodide oxidation. Hexadecanal also inhibited NADPH-oxidase. Inhibition by the non-iodinated lipid aldehydes depended on the length of their aliphatic chain: dodecanal and tridecanal gave maximal inhibition. Free iodide, 2-iodohexadecanol and palmitic acid all had no inhibitory effect. Washing treated membranes showed that the inhibition of NADPH-oxidase by hexadecanal was fully reversible, whereas that of 2-IHDA and other iodinated or brominated alkanals was irreversible. Thus the interaction between some residues of the thyroid NADPH-oxidase and the lipid aldehyde groups was favored or stabilized by the iodine atom. Modification of primary amine and thiol groups of NADPH-oxidase inhibited its activity. These groups could also be the target of lipid aldehydes. We suggest that 2-IHDA, because it inhibits TPO and more profoundly the H2O2-generating system in thyroid plasma membrane, modulates iodide metabolism in the thyrocyte and may mediate the Wolff-Chaikoff effect.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Their synthesis requires transport of iodide into thyroid follicles. The mechanisms involving the apical efflux of iodide into the follicular lumen are poorly elucidated. The discovery of mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in patients with Pendred syndrome (congenital deafness, goiter, and defective iodide organification) suggested a possible role for the encoded protein, pendrin, as an apical iodide transporter. We determined whether TSH regulates pendrin abundance at the plasma membrane and whether this influences iodide efflux. Results of immunoblot and immunofluorescence experiments reveal that TSH and forskolin rapidly increase pendrin abundance at the plasma membrane through the protein kinase A pathway in PCCL-3 rat thyroid cells. The increase in pendrin membrane abundance correlates with a decrease in intracellular iodide as determined by measuring intracellular (125)iodide and can be inhibited by specific blocking of pendrin. Elimination of the putative protein kinase A phosphorylation site T717A results in a diminished translocation to the membrane in response to forskolin. These results demonstrate that pendrin translocates to the membrane in response to TSH and suggest that it may have a physiological role in apical iodide transport and thyroid hormone synthesis.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

It has been suggested that these subjects show both diminished concentration of TBG and reduced TBG affinity for T4 (Sarne et al., 1985). We have compared 12 euthyroid aborigines with low T4 (total T4 44 +/- 5 nmol/l) and aborigines with normal T4 (T4 99 +/- 9 nmol/l, n = 12) using measurements of free T4 and T3 by equilibrium dialysis. TBG was measured both by RIA (Henning, Berlin, FRG) and a method dependent on T4 binding (Corning Immophase). Aborigines with low T4 showed lower levels of free T4 (12.6 +/- 0.6 cf. 18.7 +/- 1.0 pM), free T4 index (66 +/- 8 cf. 98 +/- 13), total T3 (1.1 +/- 0.2 cf. 1.6 +/- 0.3 nmol/l), TBG RIA (14.0 +/- 0.6 cf. 25.0 +/- 1.2 ng/l), and TBG Immophase (9.0 +/- 0.5 cf. 22.0 +/- 1.2 mg/l) (P less than 0.01), but free T3 (5.3 +/- 0.4 cf. 4.7 +/- 0.4 pM) and TSH (1.9 +/- 0.2 cf. 1.8 +/- 0.2 mU/l) were not significantly different from the values found in aborigines with normal T4. Scatchard analysis of T4 and T3 binding was performed using serum diluted 1 : 20,000 for T4 and 1 : 500 for T3 (barbitone buffer pH 8.6, 4 degrees C, dextran-coated charcoal separation). In euthyroid low T4 aborigines compared to those with normal T4, both T4 capacity (106 +/- 14 cf. 238 +/- 13 nM, P less than 0.01) and affinity (5.05 X 10(10) cf. 8.47 X 10(10) M-1, P less than 0.05) were significantly reduced.

6580279,Prevalence of Dio2(T92A) polymorphism and its association with thyroid autoimmunity,"The 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine (T‚ÇÉ) partly derives by the deiodination of the prohormone 3,5,3',5'-L-tetraiodothyronine (T‚ÇÑ) by the type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2). The single-nucleotide polymorphism in the D2 gene at position 92 (Dio(2T92A)), generates an enzyme with a reduced T‚ÇÑ to T‚ÇÉ conversion velocity. Because thyroid hormones can modulate the immune response, we hypothesized a pathophysiological role for Dio(2T92A) polymorphism in autoimmunity. The objective of this study was to investigate the Dio(2T92A) polymorphism in relation to thyroid autoimmunity (TA). We compared the prevalence of Dio(2T92A) polymorphism and serum thyroid hormone levels in healthy subjects and subjects with TA. A total of 110 subjects with TA and 106 controls were genotypized for Dio(2T92A) polymorphism. Free T‚ÇÉ (FT‚ÇÉ), free T‚ÇÑ (FT‚ÇÑ) and TSH were measured and compared with the Dio(2T92A) polymorphism. Dio(292T/A), Dio(292A/A), and Dio(292T/T) healthy subjects were 40.9%, 46.4%, and 12.7%, respectively. These prevalences were similar to those of some European countries whilst significantly different from that of Brazil. In the two groups of healthy subjects and TA subjects, Dio(2T92A) polymorphism had a similar distribution with non-significant differences. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the serum concentration of FT‚ÇÉ, FT‚ÇÑ, and TSH between subjects with different Dio(2T92A) polymorphism. The FT‚ÇÑ/FT‚ÇÉ, and TSH/FT‚ÇÉ ratios were higher in Dio(292T/T) than in Dio(292T/A) and Dio(292A/A) subjects in both TA and healthy groups, but these differences were not significant.

All the tested polyphenols inhibited TPO; the IC50 values ranged from 0.004 mM to 1.44 mM (for rosmarinic acid and rutin, respectively). All these pure phytochemical substances exhibited different modes of TPO inhibition. Rutin and rosmarinic acid showed competitive, quercetin-uncompetitive and chlorogenic acid-noncompetitive inhibition effect on TPO. Homology modeling was used to gain insight into the 3D structure of TPO and molecular docking was applied to study the interactions of the inhibitors with their target at the molecular level. Moreover, the type and strength of mutual interactions between the inhibitors (expressed as the combination index, CI) were analyzed. Slight synergism, antagonism, and moderate antagonism were found in the case of the combined addition of the pure polyphenols. Rutin and quercetin as well as rutin and rosmarinic acid acted additively (CI = 0.096 and 1.06, respectively), while rutin and chlorogenic acid demonstrated slight synergism (CI = 0.88) and rosmarinic acid with quercetin and rosmarinic acid with chlorogenic acid showed moderate antagonism (CI = 1.45 and 1.25, respectively).

6580276,Developmental and cell type-specific expression of thyroid hormone transporters in the mouse brain and in primary brain cells,"Cellular thyroid hormone uptake and efflux are mediated by transmembrane transport proteins. One of these, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is mutated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a severe mental retardation associated with abnormal thyroid hormone constellations. Since mice deficient in Mct8 exhibit a milder neurological phenotype than patients, we hypothesized that alternative thyroid hormone transporters may compensate in murine brain cells for the lack of Mct8. Using qPCR, Western Blot, and immunocytochemistry, we investigated the expression of three different thyroid hormone transporters, i.e., Mct8 and L-type amino acid transporters Lat1 and Lat2, in mouse brain. All three thyroid hormone transporters are expressed from corticogenesis and peak around birth. Primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes express Mct8, Lat1, and Lat2. Microglia specifically expresses Mct10 and Slco4a1 in addition to high levels of Lat2 mRNA and protein. As in vivo, a brain microvascular endothelial cell line expressed Mct8 and Lat1. 158N, an oligodendroglial cell line expressed Mct8 protein, consistent with delayed myelination in MCT8-deficient patients. Functional T(3)- and T(4)-transport assays into primary astrocytes showed K(M) values of 4.2 and 3.7 ŒºM for T(3) and T(4). Pharmacological inhibition of L-type amino acid transporters by BCH and genetic inactivation of Lat2 reduced astrocytic T(3) uptake to the same extent. BSP, a broad spectrum inhibitor, including Mct8, reduced T(3) uptake further suggesting the cooperative activity of several T(3) transporters in astrocytes.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
1442475,Carbaryl-induced thyroid dysfunction in the freshwater catfish Clarias batrachus,"Freshwater female catfish, Clarias batrachus, were exposed to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl (12 mg/liter for 96 hr and 5 mg/liter for 16 days) during the prespawning and spawning phases of their annual reproductive cycle. The effects on the levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), the T3/T4 ratio, and the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 were studied in serum, pharyngeal thyroid, and anterior and posterior kidney. Carbaryl exposure for 96 hr suppressed T4 but elevated T3 and the T3/T4 ratio in serum during both phases of experimentation. However, 16 days exposure caused a decline in T4 as well as in T3 and in the T3/T4 ratio. In the pharyngeal thyroid, carbaryl increased T4 as well as peroxidase activity and decreased T3 and the T3/T4 ratio. Its treatment for 96 hr did not elicit any change in the parameters studied in the anterior kidney, whereas in the posterior kidney it suppressed the levels of T4 and T3, peroxidase activity, and the T3/T4 ratio. However, carbaryl exposure for 16 days provoked increases in T4 and peroxidase activity but decreases in T3 and the T3/T4 ratio in anterior kidney. In posterior kidney, it did not change T4 and peroxidase activity, but decreased T3 and the T3/T4 ratio.

6580257,Expression of thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases at the brain barriers in the embryonic chicken: Insights into the regulation of thyroid hormone availability during neurodevelopment,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are key regulators in the development of the vertebrate brain. Therefore, TH access to the developing brain needs to be strictly regulated. The brain barriers separate the central nervous system from the rest of the body and impose specific transport mechanisms on the exchange of molecules between the general circulation and the nervous system. As such they form ideal structures for regulating TH exchange between the blood and the brain. To investigate the mechanism by which the developing brain regulates TH availability, we investigated the ontogenetic expression profiles of TH transporters, deiodinases and the TH distributor protein transthyretin (TTR) at the brain barriers during embryonic and early postnatal development using the chicken as a model. In situ hybridisation revealed expression of the TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and 10 (MCT10), organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) and L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and the inactivating type 3 deiodinase (D3) in the choroid plexus which forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. This was confirmed by quantitative PCR which additionally indicated strongly increasing expression of TTR as well as detectable expression of the activating type 2 deiodinase (D2) and the (in)activating type 1 deiodinase (D1). In the brain capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier in situ hybridisation showed exclusive expression of LAT1 and D2. The combined presence of LAT1 and D2 in brain capillaries suggests that the blood-brain barrier forms the main route for receptor-active T3 uptake into the embryonic chicken brain. Expression of multiple transporters, deiodinases and TTR in the choroid plexus indicates that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier is also important in regulating early TH availability. The impact of these barrier systems can be deduced from the clear difference in T3 and T4 levels as well as the T3/T4 ratio between the developing brain and the general circulation. We conclude that the tight regulation of TH exchange at the brain barriers from early embryonic stages is one of the factors needed to allow the brain to develop within a relative microenvironment.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
6580258,Transporters MCT8 and OATP1C1 maintain murine brain thyroid hormone homeostasis,"Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), a severe form of psychomotor retardation with abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) parameters, is linked to mutations in the TH-specific monocarboxylate transporter MCT8. In mice, deletion of Mct8 (Mct8 KO) faithfully replicates AHDS-associated endocrine abnormalities; however, unlike patients, these animals do not exhibit neurological impairments. While transport of the active form of TH (T3) across the blood-brain barrier is strongly diminished in Mct8 KO animals, prohormone (T4) can still enter the brain, possibly due to the presence of T4-selective organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1C1). Here, we characterized mice deficient for both TH transporters, MCT8 and OATP1C1 (Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO). Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice exhibited alterations in peripheral TH homeostasis that were similar to those in Mct8 KO mice; however, uptake of both T3 and T4 into the brains of Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice was strongly reduced. Evidence of TH deprivation in the CNS of Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice included highly decreased brain TH content as well as altered deiodinase activities and TH target gene expression. Consistent with delayed cerebellar development and reduced myelination, Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice displayed pronounced locomotor abnormalities. Intriguingly, differentiation of GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex was highly compromised. Our findings underscore the importance of TH transporters for proper brain development and provide a basis to study the pathogenic mechanisms underlying AHDS.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
6580259,Regulation of thyroid hormone-induced development in vivo by thyroid hormone transporters and cytosolic binding proteins,"Differential tissue sensitivity/responsivity to hormones can explain developmental asynchrony among hormone-dependent events despite equivalent exposure of each tissue to circulating hormone levels. A dramatic vertebrate example is during frog metamorphosis, where transformation of the hind limb, brain, intestine, liver, and tail are completely dependent on thyroid hormone (TH) but occurs asynchronously during development. TH transporters (THTs) and cytosolic TH binding proteins (CTHBPs) have been proposed to affect the timing of tissue transformation based on expression profiles and in vitro studies, but they have not been previously tested in vivo. We used a combination of expression pattern, relative expression level, and in vivo functional analysis to evaluate the potential for THTs (LAT1, OATP1c1, and MCT8) and CTHBPs (PKM2, CRYM, and ALDH1) to control the timing of TH-dependent development. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed complex expression profiles of THTs and CTHBPs with respect to developmental stage, tissue, and TH receptor Œ≤ (TRŒ≤) expression. For some tissues, the timing of tissue transformation was associated with a peak in the expression of some THTs or CTHBPs. An in vivo overexpression assay by tail muscle injection showed LAT1, PKM2, and CRYM increased TH-dependent tail muscle cell disappearance. Co-overexpression of MCT8 and CRYM had a synergistic effect on cell disappearance. Our data show that each tissue examined has a unique developmental expression profile of THTs and CTHBPs and provide direct in vivo evidence that the ones tested are capable of affecting the timing of developmental responses to TH.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
6580260,Thyroid hormone homeostasis in brain: possible involvement of adrenergic phenomenon in adult rat,"Background: Imbalance in thyroid hormone concentrations has been linked with profound neurobehavioral alterations in the adult. Peripheral hypothyroidism is associated with a phenomenon of central thyroid hormone homeostasis in adult rat. This central homeostasis mechanism could be maintained by adrenergic interplay due to close physiological association between sympathetic nervous system activity and thyroid hormones. The central homeostasis is characterized by increased cerebrocortical synaptosomal T3 content, deiodinase type II (DII) activity, and cAMP content. Methods: We injected specific Œ±- and Œ≤-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists and antagonists along with an anti-thyroid drug to find out any AR-mediated action on central homeostasis. Results: The Œ±2-AR agonist did not alter the onset of central homeostasis, but prolonged its duration. Similar prolongation was observed with Œ±2-AR antagonist and Œ≤-AR agonist, but these compounds amplified the normal anti-thyroid drug-induced rise in cerebrocortical T3 content on the day of onset of central homeostasis. Injections of the Œ≤-AR antagonist did not cause any perturbations. All these observations have been supported by parallel changes in cerebrocortical DII activity, cAMP and [Ca2+]i content. Conclusion: There emerges a close correlation between cerebral T3 content, DII activity, cAMP and [Ca2+]i content that are regulated by the AR system. Thus, thyroid hormone homeostasis in the adult mammalian brain is maintained primarily by the Œ≤-adrenergic pathway along with an unexpected pharmacological involvement of the Œ±-ARs.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
6580275,Regulation by human chorionic gonadotropin of sodium/iodide symporter gene expression in the JAr human choriocarcinoma cell line,"Sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) gene and protein expressions have been recently described in human cytotrophoblasts, emphasizing its potential function in the active transport of iodide from the mother to the fetus. In this study we analyzed NIS expression and function in the human JAr placental choriocarcinoma cell line. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we first demonstrated that NIS transcripts are expressed at a high level in JAr cells compared with other cell lines, including thyroid cancer cells. Functional analysis clearly showed that Jar cells are able to concentrate iodide in presence of hCG. Iodide accumulation increased after 2-h exposure to 5 IU/ml hCG, to 6-fold over the basal level after 8 h. This effect was reproduced using forskolin, the cAMP analog (Bu)(2)-cAMP, and phorbol acetate. Moreover, hCG increased both NIS mRNA after 2 h and NIS protein levels after 4 h, reaching a maximum after 8 h in both cases. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that 1) NIS is expressed in JAr cells; 2) iodide transport in JAr cells is regulated by hCG and by cAMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms; 3) the stimulation of iodide uptake is due to an increase in both NIS mRNA and protein levels; and 4) JAr cells may represent an excellent in vitro model suitable to analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in iodide transport from mother to fetus.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
6580274,Atypical expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase in thyrotrophs explains the thyroxine-mediated pituitary thyrotropin feedback mechanism,"T(4), the main product of thyroid secretion, is a critical signal in plasma that mediates the TSH-negative feedback mechanism. As a prohormone, T(4) must be converted to T(3) to acquire biological activity; thus, type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) is expected to play a critical role in this feedback mechanism. However, the mechanistic details of this pathway are still missing because, counterintuitively, D2 activity is rapidly lost in the presence of T(4) by a ubiquitin-proteasomal mechanism. In the present study, we demonstrate that D2 and TSH are coexpressed in rat pituitary thyrotrophs and that hypothyroidism increases D2 expression in these cells. Studies using two murine-derived thyrotroph cells, TtT-97 and TalphaT1, demonstrate high expression of D2 in thyrotrophs and confirm its sensitivity to negative regulation by T(4)-induced proteasomal degradation of this enzyme. Despite this, expression of the Dio2 gene in TalphaT1 cells is higher than their T(4)-induced D2 ubiquitinating capacity. As a result, D2 activity and net T(3) production in these cells are sustained, even at free T(4) concentrations that are severalfold above the physiological range. In this system, free T(4) concentrations and net D2-mediated T(3) production correlated negatively with TSHbeta gene expression. These results resolve the apparent paradox between the homeostatic regulation of D2 and its role in mediating the critical mechanism by which T(4) triggers the TSH-negative feedback.",Pilots,Unclear_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
6580262,Effects of Levothyroxine on Pregnancy Outcomes in Women With Thyroid Dysfunction: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Context ‚Ä¢ Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in pregnancy can be associated with increased complications in pregnant women and neurocognitive deficits in fetuses. Two recently published meta-analyses investigated the effects of levothyroxine (LT4) supplementation on pregnancy outcomes but did not report adverse complications and neonatal outcomes.

Weight gain and litter size of maternal mice and body weight of offspring were examined. Learning and memory abilities of offspring were tested by the Morris water maze experiment. Thyroid hormones (THs) concentrations in peripheral blood of offspring were detected by the chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. Relative mRNA expression of type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (dio1), type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (dio2), and type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (dio3) in the livers and brains of offspring were measured by QRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). Protein expression of dio3 in the livers and brains of offspring was measured by Western blot. All indexes of offspring were tested at postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND 60, respectively. As a result, administration of BDE209 decreased weight gain and litter size of maternal mice, and reduced body weight of offspring mice, prolonged escape latency and declined guardant time of offspring in the Morris water maze experiment. Moreover, BDE209 elevated serum levels of total thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), free T4, and free T3 in offspring. In addition, maternal exposure to BDE209 inhibited dio1, dio2, dio3 mRNA expression in the livers of offspring, while elevated dio1 mRNA expression and reduced dio3 mRNA expression in the brains of offspring. BDE209 also inhibited the protein expression of dio3 in the livers and brains of offspring. These results indicate that BDE209 exposure to pregnant and lactating mice can cause disruption in serum THs of offspring by altering mRNA and protein expression of iodothyronine deiodinases, which might consequently result in neurologic impairment of offspring mice.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

In humans, defects in one such protein, solute carrier SLC16A2 (MCT8) are associated with psychomotor retardation. Other proteins that transport the active form of thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) or its precursor thyroxine (T4) have been identified in vitro but the wider significance of such transporters in vivo is unclear. The development of the auditory system requires thyroid hormone and the cochlea is a primary target tissue. We have proposed that the compartmental anatomy of the cochlea would necessitate transport mechanisms to convey blood-borne hormone to target tissues. We report hearing loss in mice with mutations in Slc16a2 and a related gene Slc16a10 (Mct10, Tat1). Deficiency of both transporters results in retarded development of the sensory epithelium similar to impairment caused by hypothyroidism, compounded with a progressive degeneration of cochlear hair cells and loss of endocochlear potential. Administration of T3 largely restores the development of the sensory epithelium and limited auditory function, indicating the T3-sensitivity of defects in the sensory epithelium.

6580267,Characterization of a major development-regulated serum thyroxine-binding globulin in the euthyroid mouse,"We confirm our finding of a major development-regulated thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) in the serum of the euthyroid mouse and investigate a number of its binding, structural and regulatory properties. Between 16 days foetal and 60 days postnatal life, the thyroxine (T4)- and tri-iodothyronine (T3)-binding activities of the sera show a striking ontogenic pattern: the binding is 2-3 times higher in foetuses than in mothers, then further increases after birth, reaching between 3 and 5 days maximum values which are 7-8 times higher than the adult ones. This pattern is not correlated with the ontogenesis of the acknowledged specific (transthyretin, TTR) and non-specific (albumin, alpha 1-foetoprotein) thyroid-hormone carriers of the mouse sera. PAGE studies demonstrate that the protein responsible for the elevated binding of the perinatal period is an alpha 1-globulin, with a migration similar to that of human and rat TBGs. Scatchard analysis is consistent with the notions that the T4-binding sites of TBG have high association constants, about two orders of magnitude above the T4 sites of TTR (10(9) M-1 as against 10(7) M-1) and low capacities (37 and 4 nmol/g of serum proteins in pups and adults respectively). Isoelectric focusing (i.e.f.) demonstrates that mouse TBG is a microheterogeneous protein separable, as a function of the pH gradient, in up to 10-12 isoforms, Marked shifts of the relative abundance of isoforms in the course of development are evidenced. The modulation of the TBG binding activity by non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and the control of its synthesis by the thyroid status are also reported. Mono- and poly-unsaturated NEFAs are strong inhibitors of the TBG, although they affect TTR less readily. On the other hand, the biosynthesis and/or secretion of TBG, but not of TTR, is under thyroid-hormone control, experimental hypothyroidism inducing a marked increase of the serum TBG. The TBG of mouse behaves as a highly significant parameter of development, pointing to a likely important function of the protein in the process of maturation. Our finding of major TBGs in both euthyroid rats and mice suggests that TBG is more widely spread than was thought until now, but difficult to detect in certain species outside definite maturation stages.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

For this reason, the tadpole is considered to be an ideal bioassay system to identify disruption of thyroid function by environmental contaminants. Here we provide an in-depth review of the amphibian thyroid system with particular focus on the role that TH plays in metamorphosis. The amphibian thyroid system is similar to that of mammals and other tetrapods. We review the amphibian hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, focusing on thyroid hormone synthesis, transport, and metabolism. We also discuss the molecular mechanisms of TH action, including the role of TH receptors, the actions of TH on organogenesis, and the mechanisms that underlie the pleiotropic actions of THs. Finally, we discuss methods for evaluating thyroid disruption in frogs, including potential sites of action, relevant endpoints, candidate protocols for measuring thyroid axis disruption, and current gaps in our knowledge.

6580269,Evaluating Iodide Recycling Inhibition as a Novel Molecular Initiating Event for Thyroid Axis Disruption in Amphibians,"The enzyme iodotyrosine deiodinase (dehalogenase, IYD) catalyzes iodide recycling and promotes iodide retention in thyroid follicular cells. Loss of function or chemical inhibition of IYD reduces available iodide for thyroid hormone synthesis, which leads to hormone insufficiency in tissues and subsequent negative developmental consequences. IYD activity is especially critical under conditions of lower dietary iodine and in low iodine environments. Our objective was to evaluate the toxicological relevance of IYD inhibition in a model amphibian (Xenopus laevis) used extensively for thyroid disruption research. First, we characterized IYD ontogeny through quantification of IYD mRNA expression. Under normal development, IYD was expressed in thyroid glands, kidneys, liver, and intestines, but minimally in the tail. Then, we evaluated how IYD inhibition affected developing larval X. laevis with an in vivo exposure to a known IYD inhibitor (3-nitro-l-tyrosine, MNT) under iodine-controlled conditions; MNT concentrations were 7.4-200 mg/L, with an additional 'rescue' treatment of 200 mg/L MNT supplemented with iodide. Chemical inhibition of IYD resulted in markedly delayed development, with larvae in the highest MNT concentrations arrested prior to metamorphic climax. This effect was linked to reduced glandular and circulating thyroid hormones, increased thyroidal sodium-iodide symporter gene expression, and follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Iodide supplementation negated these effects, effectively rescuing exposed larvae. These results establish toxicological relevance of IYD inhibition in amphibians.

Design and measurements: TBII was retrospectively measured by using the conventional porcine TBII assay (pTBII) and the human recombinant TBII assay (hTBII). Specificity was adjusted at 97.5% for both assays by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plot analysis, resulting in cut-offs at 10.5% inhibition (hTBII) and 9.9% (pTBII).

Results: Even in pTBII-positive patients, hTBII values (57.6 +/- 26.1%) were significantly (P < 0.0001) higher than pTBII values (34.2 +/- 27.6%). When 139 pTBII-negative serum samples from patients with treated GD were examined, 97 samples (69.8%) were positive for hTBII. hTBII values (23.9 +/- 17.0%) were significantly (P < 0.0001) higher than pTBII values (4.1 +/- 3.3%). hTBII was positive in 13 of 13 patients who were taking antithyroid drugs but had normal serum TSH levels. When 19 serum samples from pTBII-negative untreated patients with GD were examined, 15 out of 19 (79%) were positive for hTBII. We also examined 24 patients with relapsing GD. hTBII was positive in 16 (64%) patients, whereas seven (16%) were positive for pTBII (P < 0.01). Positivity of hTBII in these untreated or relapsing GD patients was significantly higher than that of thyroid stimulating antibodies.

6580271,Inhibition of Type 1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase by Bisphenol A,"Plastics are ubiquitously present in our daily life and some components of plastics are endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenol A and phthalates. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the effect of plastic endocrine disruptors on type 1 and type 2 deiodinase activities, enzymes responsible for the conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the biologically active thyroid hormone T3, both in vitro and in vivo. Initially, we incubated rat liver type 1 deiodinase and brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase samples with 0.5 mM of the plasticizers, and the deiodinase activity was measured. Among them, only BPA was capable to inhibit both type 1 and type 2 deiodinases. Then, adult male Wistar rats were treated orally with bisphenol A (40‚Äâmg/kg b.w.) for 15 days and hepatic type 1 deiodinase and brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase activities and serum thyroid hormone concentrations were measured. In vivo bisphenol A treatment significantly reduced hepatic type 1 deiodinase activity but did not affect brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase activity. Serum T4 levels were higher in bisphenol A group, while T3 remained unchanged. T3/T4 ratio was decreased in rats treated with bisphenol A, reinforcing the idea that peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormone was affected by bisphenol A exposure. Therefore, our results suggest that bisphenol A can affect the metabolism of thyroid hormone thus disrupting thyroid signaling.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
6580283,Thyroperoxidase mRNA in quiescent and proliferating thyroid epithelial cells: expression and subcellular localization studied by in situ hybridization,"Using in situ hybridization procedure, we have investigated the regulation and the cellular localization of thyroperoxidase (TPO) messenger RNA accumulation as a marker of differentiation in dog thyroid epithelial cells in primary culture. The response to different mitogens (TSH acting through cAMP, EGF and TPA) has been compared. TPO mRNA accumulation was exquisitely dependent on a continuous TSH/cAMP stimulation. It was induced within 1 h in the whole cell population from a very low basal level. This effect was inhibited by the cAMP-independent mitogens EGF and TPA. By contrast, the TSH-induction of TPO mRNA accumulation was observed irrespectively of the proliferative activity of the cells, i.e. in the presence or the absence of insulin, which is required for mitogenesis. The short half-life of TPO mRNA (+/- 2 h) implies that it was continuously transcribed during TSH/cAMP-dependent cell cycling. As compared to another thyroid differentiation marker, thyroglobulin mRNA (Pohl et al., J. Cell Biol. 111, 663-672 (1990)), TPO mRNA accumulation differed by the rapidity of its control by cAMP, the pattern of its intercellular heterogeneity, and the unexpected segregation to a perinuclear region, probably the nuclear envelope that constitutes a specialized part of the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite these differences, both TPO and thyroglobulin gene transcriptions are unequivocally compatible with the cell cycle when induced by cAMP, at variance with the generally observed antagonism between growth and differentiation expression.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
1298543,Mode of action: developmental thyroid hormone insufficiency--neurological abnormalities resulting from exposure to propylthiouracil,"Because thyroid hormone is essential for normal brain development before and after birth, environmental chemicals that interfere with thyroid hormone signaling can adversely affect brain development. Adverse consequences of thyroid hormone insufficiency depend both on severity and developmental timing, indicating that environmental antithyroid factors may produce different effects at different developmental windows of exposure. Mechanistic studies can provide important insight into the potential impact of chemicals on human thyroid function, but relevance to humans must be systematically evaluated. This kind of analysis depends on data sets that include information about animals and humans. The drug 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) is used in animals to experimentally manipulate serum thyroid hormone levels, and in humans to treat patients, including pregnant women, with Graves' disease. A systematic analysis of the mode of action (MOA) of PTU in rats and in humans discloses similar modes of action. While the analysis predicts that PTU doses that produce thyroid hormone insufficiency in humans would adversely affect the developing brain, careful monitoring of PTU administration in pregnant and lactating humans keeps infant serum thyroid hormone levels within the normal range.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

5935783,Inhibition of the human organic anion transporter 1 by the caffeine metabolite 1-methylxanthine,"Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is daily and widely consumed in beverages and food and is mainly metabolized to 1,7-dimethylxanthine and 1-methylxanthine. Indirect clinical evidence suggests that 1-methylxanthine interacts with the organic anion transport system in the human kidney. In this study the effect of caffeine and its main metabolites on the human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) was investigated using CHO cells overexpressing hOAT1. The uptake of 6-carboxyfluorescein into CHO(hOAT) cells was significantly inhibited by > or = 100 microM of 1-methylxanthine. Five hundred micromolar 1-methylxanthine was equieffective to 100 microM probenecid. In contrast, caffeine and 1,7-dimethylxanthine did not inhibit the transport of 6-carboxyfluorescein at concentrations up to 500 microM. In conclusion, the caffeine metabolite 1-methylxanthine inhibits the transport activity of hOAT1 in vitro.

The predominant deiodinase expressed in placenta was type III (D3); type II (D2) was also present. In general terms, the activities of the enzymes D2 and D3 (and mRNAs encoding these enzymes) were higher earlier in gestation (<28 wk) than at term and displayed an inverse relationship with the duration of gestation (P < 0.05). Comparison of the relative expressions of mRNAs encoding D2 and D3 as well as their activities in placentas associated with IUGR (early and late gestational groups) with findings from normal placentas of similar gestational ages revealed no significant differences. Immunolocalization of D2 and D3 in syncytiotrophoblast (including syncytial sprouts) and cytotrophoblast of human placentas was demonstrated at both early and late gestation. Treatment of primary cultures of term cytotrophoblast cells in vitro with increasing doses of T(3) (1, 10, and 100 nM) resulted in increased expression of mRNAs encoding both D2 and D3 at 100-nM concentrations (P < 0.01) compared with control. Experiments with JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells demonstrated a similar effect on D3 mRNA at 10 and 100 nM T(3) (P < 0.01). The demonstrated changes in iodothyronine deiodinase expression in the placenta across pregnancy are likely to contribute to regulation of the thyroid hormone supply to the developing fetus. The lack of difference in deiodinase expression in normal placentas and those found in IUGR argues against placental deiodinases being responsible for the hypothyroxemia in circulating fetal thyroid hormones observed in this condition.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
6969520,The variable region of iodothyronine deiodinases directs their catalytic properties and subcellular localization,"The stereospecific removal of iodine from thyroid hormones is an essential first step for T3 action and is catalyzed by three different deiodinases: D2 and D3 remove iodine only from the outer or inner ring, respectively, whereas D1 catalyzes both pathways. We used in silico predictions from vertebrate deiodinase sequences to identify two domains: the N-terminal variable region (VR) containing the transmembrane, hinge and linker domains, and the conserved or globular region (CR). Given the high sequence and structural identity of the CR among paralogs as well as of the VR among orthologs but not paralogs, we hypothesized that both the catalytic properties and the subcellular localization rely on the VR. We used shark D2 and D3 as templates to build the chimeric enzymes D2VR/D3CR and D3VR/D2CR. Biochemical characterization revealed that D3VR/D2CR has inner-ring deiodination activity and T3 as preferred substrate, whereas D2VR/D3CR showed no deiodinating activity. Also, D2VR/D3CR and D3VR/D2CR reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasmatic membrane, respectively, as do their D2 and D3 wild-type counterparts. We conclude that the VR determines the subcellular localization and is critical in defining the catalytic properties and activity of thyroid hormone deiodinases.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
6969519,Type 2 deiodinase expression is induced by peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists in skeletal myocytes,"The thyroid hormone activating type 2 deiodinase (D2) is known to play a role in brown adipose tissue-mediated adaptive thermogenesis in rodents, but the finding of D2 in skeletal muscle raises the possibility of a broader metabolic role. In the current study, we examined the regulation of the D2 pathway in primary skeletal muscle myoblasts taken from both humans and mice. We found that pioglitazone treatment led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in primary human skeletal myocyte D2 activity; this effect was seen with other peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists. D2 activity in primary murine skeletal myotubes increased 2.8-fold in response to 5 microM pioglitazone and 1.6-fold in response to 5 nM insulin and increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to lithocholic acid (maximum response at 25 microM was approximately 3.8-fold). We compared Akt phosphorylation in primary myotubes derived from wild-type and D2 knockout (D2KO) mice: phospho-Akt was reduced by 50% in the D2KO muscle after 1 nM insulin exposure. Expression of T(3)-responsive muscle genes via quantitative RT-PCR suggests that D2KO cells have decreased thyroid hormone signaling, which could contribute to the abnormalities in insulin signaling. D2 activity in skeletal muscle fragments from both murine and human sources was low, on the order of about 0.01 fmol/min . mg of muscle protein. The phenotypic changes seen with D2KO cells support a metabolic role for D2 in muscle, hinting at a D2-mediated linkage between thyroid hormone and insulin signaling, but the low activity calls into question whether skeletal muscle D2 is a major source of plasma T(3).",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

A pancreatic hydrolysate of casein (trypticase peptone, 0.1 mg/ml) and some amino acids (cysteine, tryptophan and methionine, 50 microM each) also inhibited the TPO iodide oxidation reaction completely, whereas casamino acids (0.1 mg/ml), and tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine (50 microM each) inhibited the TPO reaction by 54% or less. A pancreatic digest of gelatin (0.1 mg/ml) or any other amino acid (50 microM) tested did not significantly decrease TPO activity. The amino acids that impair iodide oxidation also inhibit the TPO albumin iodination activity. The inhibitory amino acids contain side chains with either sulfur atoms (cysteine and methionine) or aromatic rings (tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine and phenylalanine). Among the amino acids tested, only cysteine affected the TPO guaiacol oxidation reaction, producing a transient inhibition at 25 or 50 microM. The iodide oxidation inhibitory activity of cysteine, methionine and tryptophan was reversed by increasing iodide concentrations from 12 to 18 mM, while no such effect was observed when the cofactor (H2O2) concentration was increased.

6969515,Dexamethasone inhibits growth factor-induced type 3 deiodinase activity and mRNA expression in a cultured cell line derived from rat neonatal brown fat vascular-stromal cells,"Studies examining the regulation of the type 3 deiodinase (D3) have been hampered by the lack of cell lines that constitutively express this enzyme. To address this issue, a new cell line, designated brown fat vascular-stromal (BVS-1), was generated by continuous subculturing of precursor cells derived from the vascular-stromal fraction of rat neonatal brown fat. BVS-1 cells did not differentiate into adipocytes when cultured for 5 d in DMEM supplemented with 2% newborn calf serum, 4 nM insulin, 2 nM T(3), and 10 nM dexamethasone (DEX). However, when cultured in regular medium, the cells expressed high levels of D3 activity (1-5 pmol/h per milligram protein) and mRNA. D3 mRNA was markedly induced by treatment for 6 h with epidermal growth factor, acid or basic fibroblast growth factors (10 ng/ml), or a 3-h treatment with a phorbol ester [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 1 microM] or 10% fetal bovine serum. However, preincubation of cells overnight with 50 nM DEX completely blocked the D3-inducing effects of basic fibroblast growth factor. The DEX effect was partially blocked when a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist was present. Overnight DEX treatment (50 nM) also decreased basal D3 activity by 80%. In summary, we have established BVS-1 cells as a continuous cell line useful for studying the regulation of D3 expression.

6969514,Restricted expression of NADPH oxidase/peroxidase gene (Duox) in zone VII of the ascidian endostyle,"The ascidian Ciona intestinalis, a marine invertebrate chordate, is an emerging model system for developmental and evolutionary studies. The endostyle, one of the characteristic organs of ascidians, is a pharyngeal structure with iodine-concentrating and peroxidase activities and is therefore considered to be homologous to the follicular thyroid of higher vertebrates. We have previously reported that a limited part of the endostyle (zone VII) is marked by the expression of orthologs of the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroid transcription factor-2 (TTF-2/FoxE) genes. In this study, we have identified the Ciona homolog of NADPH oxidase/peroxidase (Duox), which provides hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for iodine metabolism by TPO in the vertebrate thyroid. Expression patterns assessed by in situ hybridization have revealed that Ciona Duox (Ci-Duox) is predominantly expressed in the dorsal part of zone VII of the endostyle. Furthermore, two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization with Ci-Duox and Ciona TPO (CiTPO) has revealed that the ventral boundary of the Ci-Duox domain of expression is more dorsal than that of CiTPO. We have also characterized several genes, such as Ci-Fgf8/17/18, 5HT7, and Ci-NK4, which are predominantly expressed in the ventral part of zone VII, in a region complementary to the Ci-Duox expression domain. These observations suggest that, at the molecular level, zone VII has a complex organization that might have some impact on the specification of cell types and functions in this thyroid-equivalent element of the ascidian endostyle.",Pilots,No_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,6

We have examined the activation of the TPO gene in cultured human thyrocytes using slot-blot hybridization with a synthetic 40 mer oligonucleotide probe derived from the nucleotide sequence of the human TPO gene. The oligonucleotide probe was shown by Northern blotting to hybridize specifically to an approximately 3 kb RNA species from thyroid tissue of patients with Graves' disease, but not to RNA preparations from human or bovine retinal tissue, providing compelling evidence for the specificity of the probe for TPO mRNA. Addition of TSH (10 mU/ml) to primary thyroid cultures for 4 h led to increased TPO mRNA levels which were maximal after 48 h and significantly higher than basal even after 7 days of co-culture. Activation of TPO mRNA by TSH showed dose dependency over a wide range (0.01-100 mU/ml), with a maximal effect at 10 mU TSH/ml in cells cultured for a period of 72 h. Comparison of TPO mRNA levels with the accumulation of thyroglobulin mRNA levels following stimulation by TSH indicated that the induction of the gene encoding thyroglobulin precedes transcription of the TPO gene. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (1-100 microM) mimicked TSH in increasing TPO mRNA levels whilst, in contrast, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA; 0.01-1 microM) led to levels of TPO mRNA that were lower than basal. Thus TSH induces a specific dose-dependent activation of TPO mRNA which is mimicked by agents which increase cyclic AMP.

NH-3 binds Xenopus laevis thyroid hormone receptors directly in vitro and induces a conformation distinct from agonist-bound receptors. Transcriptional activation of a thyroid hormone response element-containing reporter gene is strongly inhibited by NH-3 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, NH-3 prevents X. laevis thyroid hormone receptors from binding to the p160 family of co-activators GRIP-1 and SRC-1 in a two-hybrid assay. To assess the potency of the compound in vivo, we used induced and spontaneous X. laevis tadpole metamorphosis, a thyroid hormone-dependent developmental process. NH-3 inhibits thyroid hormone-induced morphological changes in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits the up-regulation of endogenous thyroid hormone-responsive genes. Spontaneous metamorphosis is efficiently and reversibly arrested by NH-3 with at least the same effectiveness as the thyroid hormone synthesis inhibitor methimazole. Therefore, NH-3 is the first thyroid hormone antagonist to demonstrate potent inhibition of thyroid hormone action in both cell culture- and whole animal-based assays.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
1442437,Thiourea and cyanamide as inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase: The role of iodide,"Thiourea, methylmercaptoimidazole, propylthiouracil, and thiouracil are all potent inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase (TPO)-catalyzed iodination. Unlike the cyclic thioureylenes, thiourea at 5 mM has no effect on guaiacol oxidation. If iodide is added to guaiacol assays containing thiourea, enzyme activity is lost. The latter observation may be explained as follows. In the presence of iodide, the iodinating species [TPO.Ioxid], oxidizes thiourea to formamidine disulfide. This product decomposes to cyanamide at neutral pH. We have shown cyanamide to be an inhibitor of the peroxidative and iodinating functions of TPO. Studies in rats demonstrate that doses of thiourea which completely inhibit in vivo protein-bound iodine formation have no irreversible effect on TPO, as measured by guaiacol peroxidation after removal of the thyroids. The major in vivo action of cyanamide is similar to that of thiourea. The data suggest that the primary in vivo and in vitro mode of action of thiourea is the reversible Ioxid-trapping mechanism. The anomalous inhibition of guaiacol peroxidation seen in the presence of thiourea plus iodide derives from the formation of formamide disulfide, followed by its nonenzymic decomposition to cyanamide.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

Two studies were conducted to determine the HPT axis effects of ClO(4)(-) on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with PCB126. In dosing study I, rats were administered a single oral dose of PCB126 (0, 7.5, or 75 microg/kg) on day 0 and 9 days later ClO(4)(-) (0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg day) was added to the drinking water until euthanasia on day 22. Significant dose-dependent trends were found for all thyroid function indices measured following ClO(4)(-) in drinking water for 14 days. Seventy-five micrograms PCB126/kg resulted in a significant increase in hepatic T(4)-glucuronide formation, causing a decline in serum thyroxine and fT(4), and resulting in increased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Serum TSH was also increased in animals that received 7.5 microg PCB126/kg; no other HPT axis alterations were found in these animals. When pretreated with PCB126, the ClO(4)(-) dose trends disappeared, suggesting a less than additive effect on the HPT axis. In dosing study II, animals were given lower doses of PCB126 (0, 0.075, 0.75, or 7.5 microg/kg) on day 0, and followed with ClO(4)(-) (0 or 0.01 mg/kg day) in drinking water beginning on day 1 and continuing for several days to explore transient HPT axis effects. No statistical effects were seen for PCB126 or ClO(4)(-) alone, and no perturbations were found when administered sequentially in dosing study II. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that HPT axis disturbances following exposure to ClO(4)(-) are less than additive when pretreated with relatively high doses of PCB126.

625990,The nature of the compensatory response to low thyroid hormone in the developing brain,"Thyroid hormone is essential for normal brain development, although the degree to which the developing brain is sensitive to small perturbations in serum thyroxin is not clear. An important concept related to this is that the developing brain possesses potent mechanisms to compensate for low serum thyroid hormone, and this concept is routinely employed in discussions concerning clinical treatments or public health. However, experimental studies have not directly tested whether (or the degree to which) putative compensatory mechanisms can ameliorate the consequences of small reductions in serum thyroxin (T(4)). To formally test this concept, we employed a model of graded T(4) reductions using doses of propylthiouracil (PTU) that were 200- to 67-fold lower than the dose traditionally used to produce hypothyroidism in rats. PTU produced a stepwise decrease in serum total T(4), and a stepwise increase in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), in type 2 deiodinase mRNA expression and enzyme activity in the brain, and in the expression of the mRNA encoding the tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) transporter MCT8 in the postnatal day (P) 15 cortex. However, the mRNA encoding RC3/neurogranin, a direct target of T(3) action, exhibited a strong negative linear correlation with serum total T(4) despite these adaptive responses. In addition, single-cell analysis of RC3 mRNA levels in cortical neurones demonstrated that the co-expression of MCT8 did not alter the relationship between RC3 mRNA and serum T(4). These findings do not support the currently envisioned concept of the developing brain being capable of compensating for low T(4).",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Previous studies have suggested that PBDEs can disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis and the developing central nervous system in rodents, but few studies have determined whether PBDEs cause similar effects in birds. An in vitro method was used to determine effects of a commercial PBDE flame retardant (DE-71) on mRNA expression in primary chicken neuronal cells derived from the cerebral hemisphere. Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to quantify changes in mRNA abundance of genes associated with the thyroid hormone pathway; thyroid hormone receptors (TRalpha and TRbeta) and transthyretin (TTR). We also used a new differential display PCR methodology, fluorescent RNA arbitrarily primed PCR (FRAP-PCR), to determine additional effects of DE-71 on mRNA expression. Neither of the TRs responded to DE-71 exposure, but TTR mRNA decreased approximately 2-fold following exposure to 0.1, 1 and 3 microM DE-71.

Zygotic expression of TPO was detected in neurula stage embryos. Expression was observed in the notochord and later in the thyroid. The notochord was also a common site of expression for 5'DII and 5DIII. Other sites of 5'DII expression are the otic vesicles, retina, liver, blood-forming region, branchial arches and brain. 5DIII is also expressed in the brain, retina, liver, developing pro-nephros, blood-forming region and branchial arches. Embryos exposed to the TPO inhibitor methimazole showed a distinctive dose-dependent phenotype of a crimped notochord and shortened axis, together with alterations in (125)I(-) uptake.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>These data suggest a novel extrathyroidal role for TH during early development, and support the proposal that embryos require thyroid signalling for normal development prior to metamorphosis.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

5973867,"Deiodinase type 1 activity is expressed in the prostate of pubescent rats and is modulated by thyroid hormones, prolactin and sex hormones","The aim of this study was to characterize the type of 5'-deiodinase activity in the prostate of pubescent rats (7-8 weeks), to establish its distribution in the lobes (ventral, dorsolateral, and anterior), and to analyze its modulation by prolactin (PRL), testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 17beta-estradiol (E(2)). Our results showed that the enzymatic activity was highly susceptible to inhibition by 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil and gold thioglucose, its preferential substrate was reverse tri-iodothyronine (rT(3)), it exhibited a low dithiothreitol requirement (5 mM), and the apparent K(m) and V(max) values for substrate (rT(3)) were approximately 0.25 microM and 9.0 pmol liberated/mg protein per hour, respectively. All these characteristics indicate the preferential expression of type 1 deiodinase (D1), which was corroborated by demonstrating the presence of D1 mRNA in prostate. D1 activity was detected in all lobes and was most abundant in the dorsolateral. Although we detected type 2 deiodinase (D2) mRNA expression, the D2 activity was almost undetectable. D1 activity was enhanced in animals with hyperthyroidism and hyperprolactinemia, in intact animals treated with finasteride (inhibitor of local DHT production), and in castrated animals with E(2) replacement. In contrast, activity diminished in castrated animals with testosterone replacement. Our results suggest that thyroid hormones, PRL, and E(2) exert a positive modulation on D1 activity, while testosterone and DHT exhibit an inhibitory effect.

In addition, cis-DCCA and trans-DCCA were inversely associated with inhibin B (p for trend=0.03 and 0.02, respectively). Finally, there was evidence that trans-DCCA was inversely associated with testosterone and free androgen index (the ratio of testosterone to sex hormone binding globulin; p for trend=0.09 and 0.05, respectively).

Subjects with body-mass index (BMI) ‚â•30kg/m(2) were eligible. After detailed analysis and exclusion of unavailable cases, subjects diagnosed with and without metabolic syndrome were compared for TSH, anti-TPO, and 25(OH)D.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Of the study participants (n=548; men/women, 64/484), 277 were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome [Met-S (+)]. Met-S (+) patients had a higher mean BMI (36.4 vs. 32.3kg/m(2), p<.001) and percentage body fat (PBF) (39.2 vs. 35.3%, p<.001), but similar TSH (2.1 vs. 2.2mIU/mL, p=.759), anti-TPO (12 vs. 13IU/mL, p=.483), 25(OH)D (13.2 vs. 12.6ng/mL, p=.409), and calcium-phosphorus product (28.7 vs. 29.5mg/dL, p=0.275), compared to Met-S (-) subjects.

5935785,Tissue-specific thyroid hormone deprivation and excess in monocarboxylate transporter (mct) 8-deficient mice,"Mutations of the X-linked thyroid hormone (TH) transporter (monocarboxylate transporter, MCT8) produce in humans unusual abnormalities of thyroid function characterized by high serum T3 and low T4 and rT3. The mechanism of these changes remains obscure and raises questions regarding the regulation of intracellular availability and metabolism of TH. To study the pathophysiology of MCT8 deficiency, we generated Mct8 knockout mice. Male mice deficient in Mct8 (Mct8(-/y)) replicate the thyroid abnormalities observed in affected men. TH deprivation and replacement with L-T3 showed that suppression of TSH required higher serum levels T3 in Mct8(-/y) than wild-type (WT) littermates, indicating hypothalamus and/or thyrotroph resistance to T3. Furthermore, T4 is required to maintain the high serum T3 level because the latter was not different between the two genotypes during administration of T3. Mct8(-/y) mice have 2.3-fold higher T3 content in liver associated with 6.1- and 3.1-fold increase in deiodinase 1 mRNA and enzymatic activity, respectively. The relative T3 excess in liver of Mct8(-/y) mice produced a decrease in serum cholesterol (79 +/- 18 vs. 137 +/- 38 mg/dl in WT) and an increase in alkaline phosphatase (107 +/- 23 vs. 58 +/- 3 U/liter in WT) levels. In contrast, T3 content in cerebrum was 1.8-fold lower in Mct8(-/y) mice, associated with a 1.6- and 10.6-fold increase in D2 mRNA and enzymatic activity, respectively, as previously observed in TH-deprived WT mice. We conclude that cell-specific differences in intracellular TH content due to differences in contribution of the various TH transporters are responsible for the unusual clinical presentation of this defect, in contrast to TH deficiency.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
5935784,High incidence of thyroid dysfunction despite prophylaxis with potassium iodide during (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine treatment in children with neuroblastoma,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Treatment modalities like targeted radiotherapy with (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) improve survival rates after neuroblastoma (NB). Radiation to the thyroid gland can lead to hypothyroidism and even malignancy. Because hypothyroidism after (131)I-MIBG treatment was reported, the current KI prophylaxis against thyroidal radiation damage was evaluated.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The incidence, pathogenesis, and consequences of thyroid dysfunction among 42 NB patients treated with (131)I-MIBG were evaluated retrospectively. Efficacy of KI prophylaxis was established by measuring thyroidal radioiodide uptake. Thyroid damage was expressed as thyrotropin elevation (TE, plasma concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone > or = 4.5 mU/L).<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The mean followup was 2.3 years (range, 0.1-8.5). The mean number of treatments with (131)I-MIBG was 3.3. Of 428 scintigrams, uptake of (131)I in the thyroid was visible in 92 (21.0%). Twenty two patients (52.4 %) presented TE after a mean period of 1.4 years (range, 0.1-5.8). Clinical signs of hypothyroidism were not observed. Eight patients received suppletion therapy with thyroxine. Thyrotropin elevation was transient in four patients. Of 25 survivors, with a mean followup of 3.5 years, 16 (64%) developed TE. No correlation was found between TE and thyroid visualization after (131)I-MIBG administration or the number of treatments. No abnormalities were seen by ultrasound imaging of the thyroid.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Occurrence of thyroid dysfunction after treatment with (131)I-MIBG for NB is high, in spite of KI prophylaxis. Close followup of thyroid function and structure is required in patients treated with (131)I-MIBG.

3012235,Disruption of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase activity in cultured human glial cells by polybrominated diphenyl ethers,"Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are endocrine disruptors and suspected neurodevelopmental toxicants. While the direct mechanisms of neurodevelopmental toxicity have not been fully elucidated, it is conceivable that alterations in thyroid hormone levels in the developing brain may contribute to these effects. Cells within the brain locally convert thyroxine (T-4) to the biologically active triiodothyronine (T-3) through the action of the selenodeiodinase type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2). Previous studies have demonstrated that PBDEs can alter hepatic deiodinase activity both in vitro and in vivo; however, the effects of PBDEs on the deiodinase isoforms expressed in the brain are not well understood. Here, we studied the effects of several individual PBDEs and hydroxylated metabolites (OH-BDEs) on DIO2 activity in astrocytes, a specialized glial cell responsible for production of more than 50% of the T3 required by the brain. Primary human astrocytes and H4 glioma cells were exposed to individual PBDEs or OH-BDEs at concentrations up to 5 mu M. BDE-99 decreased DIO2 activity by 50% in primary astrocyte cells and by up to 80% in the H4 cells at doses of >= 500 nM. 3-OH-BDE-47, 6-OH-BDE-47, and 5'-OH-BDE-99 also decreased DIO2 activity in cultured H4 glioma cells by 45-80% at doses of approximately 1-5 mu M. Multiple mechanisms appear to contribute to the decreased DIO2 activity, including weakened expression of DIO2 mRNA, competitive inhibition of DIO2, and enhanced post-translational degradation of DIO2. We conclude that decreases in DIO2 activity caused by exposure to PBDEs may play a role in the neurodevelopmental deficits caused by these toxicants.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

In the present study, we further investigated the effects of resveratrol, with evaluation of the expression of additional thyroid-specific genes in the FRTL-5 rat thyroid cell line: thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, TSH receptor, Nkx2-1, Foxe1 and Pax8. We observed decreased expression of these genes in FRTL-5¬†cells treated with 10¬†ŒºM resveratrol. The effects of resveratrol was further evaluated in¬†vivo using Sprague-Dawley rats treated with resveratrol 25¬†mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally, for 60 days. No clinical signs of hypothyroidism were seen, although the treated rats showed significant increase in thyroid size. Serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels were in the normal range, with significantly higher TSH seen in resveratrol-treated rats, compared with control rats. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed increased proliferative activity in the thyroid from resveratrol-treated rats.

Herein we describe the development of a HTPS TPO inhibition assay. Rat thyroid microsomes and a fluorescent peroxidase substrate, Amplex UltraRed (AUR, LifeTechnologies), were employed in an endpoint assay for comparison to the existing kinetic guaiacol (GUA) oxidation assay. Following optimization of assay metrics including Z', dynamic range, and activity using methimazole (MMI), the assay was tested with a 21-chemical training set. The potency of MMI-induced TPO inhibition was greater with AUR compared to GUA. The dynamic range and Z' score with MMI were as follows: 127-fold and 0.62 for the GUA assay, 18-fold and 0.86 for the 96-well AUR assay, and 11.5-fold and 0.93 for the 384-well AUR assay. The 384-well AUR assay drastically reduced animal use, requiring one-tenth of the rat thyroid microsomal protein needed for the GUA 96-well format assay. Fourteen chemicals inhibited TPO, with a relative potency ranking of MMI &gt; ethylene thiourea &gt; 6-propylthiouracil &gt; 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxy-benzophenone &gt; 2-mercaptobenzothiazole &gt; 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole &gt; genistein &gt; 4-propoxyphenol &gt; sulfamethazine &gt; daidzein &gt; 4-nonylphenol &gt; triclosan &gt; iopanoic acid &gt; resorcinol.

Exposures to chemicals, including chlorpyrifos, have been found to modify thyroid signaling at environmentally relevant levels in animal studies. The aim of this study was to examine circulating T4 and TSH levels in relation to urinary concentrations of 3, 5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of the organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl, using data from individuals 12 years and older from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). NHANES datasets from 1999 to 2000 and 2001-2002 were combined, and individuals with thyroid disease, those taking thyroid medications, and pregnant women were excluded (N = 3249). Multivariable linear regression models for relationships between log-transformed urinary TCPY and serum total T(4) or log (TSH) were constructed adjusting for important covariates. Models were stratified by sex and a categorical age variable (12-18, 18-40, 40-60, and &gt;60 years).

In the current study six in¬†vitro bioassays indicative of different mechanisms of thyroid disruption and one whole animal in¬†vivo assay were applied to 9 model compounds and 4 different water samples (treated wastewater, surface water, drinking water and ultra-pure lab water; both unspiked and spiked with model compounds) to determine their ability to detect thyroid active compounds. Most assays correctly identified and quantified the model compounds as agonists or antagonists, with the reporter gene assays being the most sensitive. However, the reporter gene assays did not detect significant thyroid activity in any of the water samples, suggesting that activation or inhibition of the thyroid hormone receptor is not a relevant mode of action for thyroid endocrine disruptors in water. The thyroperoxidase (TPO) inhibition assay and transthyretin (TTR) displacement assay (FITC) detected activity in the surface water and treated wastewater samples, but more work is required to assess if this activity is a true measure of thyroid activity or matrix interference.

4205837,Disruption of thyroid hormone functions by low dose exposure of tributyltin: an in vitro and in vivo approach,"Triorganotins, such as tributyltin chloride (TBTCl), are environmental contaminants that are commonly found in the antifouling paints used in ships and other vessels. The importance of TBTCl as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) in different animal models is well known; however, its adverse effects on the thyroid gland are less understood. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the thyroid-disrupting effects of this chemical using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. We used HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells for the in vitro studies, as they are a thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-positive and thyroid responsive cell line. For the in vivo studies, Swiss albino male mice were exposed to three doses of TBTCl (0.5, 5 and 50Œºg/kg/day) for 45days. TBTCl showed a hypo-thyroidal effect in vivo. Low-dose treatment of TBTCl exposure markedly decreased the serum thyroid hormone levels via the down-regulation of the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) genes by 40% and 25%, respectively, while augmenting the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) expression was up-regulated in the thyroid glands of treated mice by 6.6-fold relative to vehicle-treated mice (p&lt;0.05). In the transient transactivation assays, TBTCl suppressed T3 mediated transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, TBTCl was found to decrease the expression of TR. The present study thus indicates that low concentrations of TBTCl suppress TR transcription by disrupting the physiological concentrations of T3/T4, followed by the recruitment of NCoR to TR, providing a novel insight into the thyroid hormone-disrupting effects of this chemical.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
4198597,Evaluation on the thyroid disrupting mechanism of malathion in Fischer rat thyroid follicular cell line FRTL-5,"Thyroid hormones are involved in many important physiological activities including regulation of energy metabolism, development of nervous system, maintenance of cerebral functions, and so on. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that interfere with thyroid functions raise serious concerns due to their frequent misuse in areas where regulations are poorly implemented. In addition, chemicals that are originally regarded safe may now be considered as toxic with the development of life sciences. Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide that is widely applied and distributed in agricultural and residential settings. Due to the low acute toxicity and rapid degradation, malathion is not listed as a primary thyroid disrupting chemical. However, emerging evidences reported that malathion affected thyroperoxidase catalyzed iodide oxidation which in turn influenced thyroid hormone transportation, and enhanced parathyroid hyperplasia prevalence. Nevertheless, direct effect of malathion on thyroid hormone biosynthesis remains to be elucidated. This study investigated the effects of thyroid disruption of malathion in Fischer rat thyroid follicular cell line, FRTL-5. Transcriptional and translational analyses on thyroglobulin demonstrated that both mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly inhibited by malathion. Cellular cAMP level and TSH receptor expression were distinctly reduced by malathion (6.0‚Äâ¬µg/ml). These results suggested that malathion directly disrupted the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone and the mechanism involved down-regulation of TSH receptor and cellular cAMP. This subsequently led to the suppression of TSH dependent signal transduction, TG transcription inhibition, and obstruction of thyroid hormone biosynthesis.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
1409505,Antithyroid and goitrogenic effects of millet: role of C-glycosylflavones,"Pearl millet [Pennisetum millet (L.) leeke] is the main source of food energy for the rural poor in many areas of the semiarid tropics. Epidemiological evidence suggests that millet may play a role in the genesis of endemic goiter in these areas, and sparse experimental data in rats support this suspicion. This study was undertaken to determine in vivo in rats and in vitro using porcine thyroid slices and a thyroid peroxidase (TPO) assay the goitrogenic and antithyroid effects of millet diets, extracts of millet, and certain pure compounds contained therein. For use in these studies, whole grain millet was progressively dehulled to yield successively four bran and four flour fractions in which direct analyses revealed progressively lower concentrations of C-glycosylflavones. In vivo feeding of bran fraction 1, that richest in C-glycosylflavones, led to a significant increase in thyroid weight and antithyroid effects. Feeding of bran fraction 2, the next richest in C-glycosylflavones, produced similar, but less marked, changes. In vitro studies of 125I metabolism using porcine thyroid slices indicated that extracts of bran fractions 1 and 2 were most potent, producing changes similar to those produced by methimazole (MMI). At a concentration of 60 mumol/L, glucosylvitexin, the major C-glycosylflavone present in millet, had effects comparable to those of 1 mumol/L MMI. Similarly, in studies of porcine TPO, extracts of bran fraction 1 caused pronounced (85%) inhibition of enzyme activity, and progressively less inhibition was induced by extracts of bran fractions 2, 3, and 4. Overall, the TPO-inhibiting activities of the various millet fractions closely correlated with their C-glycosylflavone concentrations. Three C-glycosylflavones present concentrations. Three C-glycosylflavones present in millet, glucosylvitexin, glycosylorientin, and vitexin, also inhibited TPO activity. Thus, in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that millet diets rich in C-glycosylflavones produce goitrogenic and antithyroid effects similar to those of certain other antithyroid agents and small doses of MMI. We conclude that in areas of iodine deficiency in which millet is a major component of the diet, its ingestion may contribute to the genesis of endemic goiter.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
4003633,Differential responses to ligands of overexpressed thyroid hormone and retinoid X receptors in a Xenopus cell line and in vivo,"In an attempt to explain the contrasting patterns of expression of Xenopus thyroid hormone (xTR) and retinoid X (xRXR) receptor genes and to extend our understanding of the role of heterodimerization of these receptors during amphibian metamorphosis, we have investigated the response to their respective ligands of cells in which xTR and xRXR were overexpressed. Results obtained with two separate approaches are now described. In the first, 3,3'5-triiodothyronine (t3) was found to strongly upregulate xTR beta mRNA in XTC-2 cells, but not of xTR alpha or xRXR alpha mRNAs, while xRXR gamma transcripts could not be detected. 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) did not substantially influence the expression of any of these four receptor genes. When transcription from three different thyroid response elements (TREs) (a palindromic TREpal, an inverted repeat +6 [F2] and a direct repeat +4[DR+4] as present in the promoter of xTR beta gene) was measured in XTC-2 cells in which xTR beta and xRXR alpha were overexpressed, only T3 upregulated transcription while 9-cis-RA, alone or together with T3, was ineffective. 9-cis-RA however enhanced transcription from an RXR responsive element (RXR-RE). THe second approach involved overexpression of xTR beta and xRXR alpha in premetamorphic Xenopus tadpole tail muscle followed by measuring the response of the tails to T3 in organ culture. After validating the microinjection/culture procedure histochemically, we found that T3 enhanced transcription from the xTR beta DR +4 TRE in tails in which xTR beta was overexpressed but the overexpression of xRXR alpha failed to modify this response. It is concluded that in both XTC cells and tadpole tails, overexpressed xRXR fails to modify the enhanced transcriptional response of endogenous and overexpressed xTR beta to T3 and that exogenous 9-cis-RA is ineffective.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
1030804,The minimal arsenic concentration required to inhibit the activity of thyroid peroxidase activity in vitro,"Arsenical compounds are known to interfere with normal thyroid function. Therefore, we designed an experiment to determine the minimal concentration of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) required to inhibit thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity in vitro. The activity of commercially prepared human TPO was assayed spectrophotometrically in the absence (control) or presence of arsenic (0.1, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 ppm) during a 10-min incubation period. The results of this study indicate a significant dose-response relationship with the highest concentration of arsenic producing the greatest amount of TPO inhibition. Compared to controls, 0.1 ppm arsenic had no effect on TPO activity. Incubation for 2 min in the presence of 1.0, 5.0, or 10 ppm arsenic inhibited TPO activity to 4%, 9%, and 9% of control, respectively. After 10 min incubation in the presence of 1.0 or 5.0 ppm arsenic, TPO activity returned to 92% and 54% of control, respectively, while the presence of 10 ppm arsenic further inhibited TPO activity to 1% of control. In summary, arsenic trioxide inhibits in vitro TPO activity in a dose-dependent manner, and the minimal dose required to inhibit this activity is between 0.1 and 1 ppm.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
1400998,Changes in thyroid peroxidase activity in response to various chemicals,"Thyroperoxidase (TPO) is a large heme-containing glycoprotein that catalyzes the transfer of iodine to thyroglobulin during thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis. Previously, we established an in vitro assay for TPO activity based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into human follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC-238) cells. It is important to determine whether environmental chemicals can disrupt TPO activity because it is an important factor in the TH axis. In this study, we used our assay to examine the changes in TPO activity in response to various chemicals, including benzophenones (BPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Overall, BPs, PAHs, and POPs slightly altered TPO activity at low doses, as compared with the positive controls methimazole (MMI), genistein, and 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxy BP. Benzophenone, benzhydrol, 3-methylchloranthracene, pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(e)pyrene, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and heptachlor decreased TPO activity, while 2,4-dihydroxy BP, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxy BP, and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene increased TPO activity. From these data, we can predict the disruption of TPO activity by various chemicals as a sensitive TH end point.

In brown adipocytes, TUDCA or 4-PBA induced T3-dependent genes and oxygen consumption (‚àº2-fold), an effect partially lost in D2 knockout cells. In wild type, but not in D2 knockout mice, administration of TUDCA lowered the respiratory quotient, doubled brown adipose tissue D2 activity and normalized the glucose intolerance associated with high fat feeding.

3974331,Transport of thyroid hormones is selectively inhibited by 3-iodothyronamine,"Thyroid hormone transporters are responsible for the cellular uptake of thyroid hormones, which is a prerequisite for their subsequent metabolism and action at nuclear thyroid hormone receptors. A recently discovered thyroid hormone derivative, 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM), has distinct biological effects that are opposite those of thyroid hormone. Here we investigate the effects of T(1)AM on thyroid hormone transporters using COS-1 cells transfected with the multispecific organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) 1A2, 1B3, and 1C1, as well as the specific thyroid hormone transporters MCT8 and MCT10, and show that T(1)AM displays differential inhibition of T(3) and T(4) cellular uptake by these transporters. T(1)AM inhibits T(3) and T(4) transport by OATP1A2 with IC(50) values of 0.27 and 2.1 microM, respectively. T(4) transport by OATP1C1, which is thought to play a key role in thyroid hormone transport across the blood-brain barrier, is inhibited by T(1)AM with an IC(50) of 4.8 microM. T(1)AM also inhibits both T(3) and T(4) uptake via MCT8, the most specific thyroid hormone transporter identified to date, with IC(50) values of 95 and 31 microM, respectively. By contrast, T(1)AM has no effect on thyroid hormone transport by OATP1B3 and MCT10. Given that OATP1A2, OATP1C1, and MCT8 are all present in the brain, T(1)AM may play an important role in modulating thyroid hormone delivery and activity in specific target regions in the central nervous system.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
386406,Association of duoxes with thyroid peroxidase and its regulation in thyrocytes,"CONTEXT: Thyroid hormone synthesis requires H(2)O(2) produced by dual oxidases (Duoxes) and thyroperoxidase (TPO). Defects in this system lead to congenital hypothyroidism. H(2)O(2) damage to the thyrocytes may be a cause of cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate whether Duox and TPO, the H(2)O(2) producer and consumer, might constitute a complex in the plasma membrane of human thyroid cells, thus maximizing efficiency and minimizing leakage and damage. DESIGN: The interaction between Duox and TPO was studied by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting of plasma membranes from incubated follicles prepared from freshly resected human thyroid tissue from patients undergoing thyroidectomy, and COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the entire Duoxes or truncated [amino (NH2) or carboxyl (COOH) terminal]. RESULTS: The following results were reached: 1) Duox and TPO from membranes are coprecipitated, 2) this association is up-regulated through the Gq-phospholipase C-Ca(2+)-protein kinase C pathway and down-regulated through the Gs-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, 3) H(2)O(2) increases the association of Duox1 and Duox2 to TPO in cells and in membranes, and 4) truncated NH(2)- or COOH-terminal Duox1 and Duox2 proteins show different binding abilities with TPO. CONCLUSION: Coimmunoprecipitations show that Duox and TPO locate closely in the plasma membranes of human thyrocytes, and this association can be modulated by H(2)O(2), optimizing working efficiency and minimizing H(2)O(2) spillage. This association could represent one part of a postulated pluriprotein complex involved in iodination.

6556922,Thyroid Hormone Distributor Proteins During Development in Vertebrates,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are ancient hormones that not only influence the growth, development and metabolism of vertebrates but also affect the metabolism of (at least some) bacteria. Synthesized in the thyroid gland (or follicular cells in fish not having a discrete thyroid gland), THs can act on target cells by genomic or non-genomic mechanisms. Either way, THs need to get from their site of synthesis to their target cells throughout the body. Despite being amphipathic in structure, THs are lipophilic and hence do not freely diffuse in the aqueous environments of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (in contrast to hydrophilic hormones). TH Distributor Proteins (THDPs) have evolved to enable the efficient distribution of THs in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. In humans, the THDPs are albumin, transthyretin (TTR), and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). These three proteins have distinct patterns of regulation in both ontogeny and phylogeny. During development, an additional THDP with higher affinity than those in the adult, is present during the stage of peak TH concentrations in blood. Although TTR is the only THDP synthesized in the central nervous system (CNS), all THDPs from blood are present in the CSF (for each species). However, the ratio of albumin to TTR differs in the CSF compared to the blood. Humans lacking albumin or TBG have been reported and can be asymptomatic, however a human lacking TTR has not been documented. Conversely, there are many diseases either caused by TTR or that have altered levels of TTR in the blood or CSF associated with them.

3683226,Simple and Rapid In Vitro Assay for Detecting Human Thyroid Peroxidase Disruption,"A simple and rapid luminometric assay for the detection of chemical inhibitors of human thyroid peroxidase (hTPO) activity was developed and validated with 10 model compounds. hTPO was derived from the human thyroid follicular cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 and its activity was quantified by measuring the oxidation of luminol in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which results in emission of light at 428 nm. In this assay, hTPO activity was shown to be inhibited by 5 known TPO inhibitors and not inhibited by 5 non-inhibitors. Similar results were obtained with porcine TPO (pTPO). The inhibition of hTPO by the model compounds was also tested with guaiacol and Ampliflu Red as alternative indicator substrates. While all substrates allowed the detection of pTPO activity and its inhibition, only the Ampliflu Red and luminol-based methods were sensitive enough to allow the quantification of hTPO activity from Nthy-ori 3-1 cell lysates. Moreover, luminol gave results with a narrower 95% confidence interval and therefore more reliable data. Whole extracts of fast-growing Nthy-ori 3-1 cells circumvent the need for animal-derived thyroid organs, thereby reducing costs, eliminating potential contamination and providing the possibility to study human instead of porcine TPO. Overall, the application of luminol and Nthy-ori 3-1 cell lysate for the detection of the disruption of hTPO activity was found to represent a valuable in vitro alternative and a possible candidate for inclusion within a high throughput integrated testing strategy for the detection of compounds that potentially interfere with normal thyroid function in vivo.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
461756,Circulating thyroid hormone levels and iodothyronine deiodinase activities in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) following dietary exposure to Endosulfan and Aroclor 1254,"We evaluated the effects of two organochlorinated environmental contaminants, Endosulfan and Aroclor 1254 on peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism and thyroid hormone plasma levels in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Tilapia were exposed through diet to 0.1 and 0.5 gg g(-1) of Endosulfan and 0.5 mu g g(-1) of Aroclor 1254 for 21 and 35 days. Decreased plasma T4 and rT3 levels were observed in tilapia exposed to the lower dose of Endosulfan, while treatment with a higher dose and Aroclor 1254 produced no changes. Plasma rT3 levels were not affected by these compounds. Hepatic type I deiodinase (D1) activity was depressed by a lower dose of Endosulfan and hepatic type III (133) activity was increased following 35 days of exposure to the lower dose-of Endosulfan and following 21 and 35 days of exposure to Aroclor 1254; while type II (D2) remained unchanged in liver as well as in all other organs analysed. Apart from hepatic D3 activity, Endosulfan and Aroclor 1254 also increased D3 activity in gill, but not in other tested organs. It is concluded that dietary exposure of tilapia to Endosulfan or Aroclor 1254 can lead to changes in circulating thyroid hormone levels and/or in peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The changes in hormone metabolism differ between tissues, eventually reflecting tissue-specific differences in adaptation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

4773591,Estradiol increases proliferation and down-regulates the sodium/iodide symporter gene in FRTL-5 cells,"Goiter (increased thyroid gland size) is more prevalent in women than men, even in areas where iodine levels in the diet are sufficient. We investigated a possible role of estrogen on thyroid follicular cell growth using rat FRTL-5 thyroid follicular cells as a model. Estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) messenger RNA was present in FRTL-5 cells using a RT-PCR assay and was confirmed by Western blot analysis. An estrogen-responsive reporter gene was transfected into FRTL-5 cells to test the functionality of the endogenous ERs. Estradiol increased the activity of the reporter gene, and the antagonist, ICI182780, inhibited ER-dependent transcription. To extend this analysis, we examined the effect of estradiol on FRTL-5 cell growth. Estradiol increased FRTL-5 cell growth in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in either the absence or presence of TSH. Because iodine is known to inhibit thyroid cell growth, the effect of estradiol on the expression of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) was assessed as a potential target of estrogen action. Estradiol blocked TSH-induced NIS expression, and treatment of cells with estradiol and ICI182780 restored TSH-induced NIS expression to normal levels. These data demonstrate that FRTL-5 cells contain functional ERs that enhance cell growth and inhibit expression of the NIS. The demonstration of a direct effect of estradiol on thyroid follicular cells raises the possibility that it may play a role in the sexually dimorphic prevalence of goiter.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
3974277,Tyrosine kinase inhibitors noncompetitively inhibit MCT8-mediated iodothyronine transport,"<strong>CONTEXT: </strong>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are used for the treatment of various cancers. Case reports and clinical trials have reported abnormal thyroid function tests (TFT) after treatment with sunitinib, imatinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. An increased requirement for levothyroxine was reported in thyroidectomized patients during TKI treatment.<br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>We hypothesized that abnormal TFT are compatible with inhibition of thyroid hormone (TH) transporters and subsequently reduced pituitary-TH feedback. Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a TH transmembrane transporter in brain, pituitary, and other organs. MCT8 mutation leads to abnormal TFT in patients and respective mouse models. We tested whether TKI are able to inhibit MCT8-mediated TH uptake into cells.<br /><br /><strong>DESIGN: </strong>Madin-Darby-canine kidney (MDCK1) cells stably expressing human MCT8 were exposed in vitro to TKI at increasing concentrations, and MCT8-mediated [(125)I]T(3) uptake and efflux were measured. The mode of inhibition was determined.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>TKI exposure dose-dependently inhibited MCT8-dependent T(3) and T(4) uptake. IC(50) values for sunitinib, imatinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib ranged from 13-38 Œºm, i.e. similar to the Michaelis-Menten constant K(m) for T(3) and T(4), 4 and 8 Œºm, respectively. Kinetic experiments revealed a noncompetitive mode of inhibition for all TKI tested.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Partial inhibition by TKI of pituitary or hypothalamic TH feedback may increase TSH or increase the levothyroxine requirement of thyroidectomized patients.

Although both exert an antithyroid effect primarily by blocking thyroid peroxidase activity, their molecular structure and other actions are different. We hypothesized that PTU and MMI may have differential effects on thyroid-specific gene expression and function.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The effects of PTU and MMI on thyroid-specific gene expression and function were examined in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells using DNA microarray, reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and radioiodine uptake studies.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>DNA microarray analysis showed a marked increase in sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) gene expression after PTU treatment, whereas MMI had no effect. RT-PCR and real-time PCR analysis revealed that PTU-induced NIS mRNA levels were comparable to those elicited by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). PTU increased 5'-1880-bp and 5'-1052-bp activity of the rat NIS promoter. While PTU treatment also increased NIS protein levels, the size of the induced protein was smaller than that induced by TSH, and the protein localized predominantly in the cytoplasm rather than the plasma membrane. Accumulation of (125)I in FRTL-5 cells was increased by PTU stimulation, but this effect was weaker than that produced by TSH.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>We found that PTU induces NIS expression and iodide uptake in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells in the absence of TSH.

4773593,Inverse Agonist of Estrogen-Related Receptor γ Enhances Sodium Iodide Symporter Function Through Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling in Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Cells,"<strong>UNLABELLED: </strong>Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), a rare thyroid cancer with poor prognosis, is associated with insufficient function of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). Estrogen-related receptor Œ≥ (ERRŒ≥) is a member of the orphan nuclear receptors with important functions in cell development and homeostasis. However, there are no reports that demonstrate whether ERRŒ≥ is related to NIS function. Here, we evaluated the role of ERRŒ≥ in the regulation of NIS function in ATC cells using GSK5182, an inverse agonist of ERRŒ≥.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Two ATC cell lines, BHT-101 and CAL62, were incubated with GSK5182 at various time points and doses. The NIS function in the ATC cells was serially assessed by their uptake of radioiodine. The effects of GSK5182 on ERRŒ≥ and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, as well as on NIS protein, were evaluated by immunoblot assay. To examine whether the GSK5182-induced NIS functional activity can be affected by inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway, the MAP kinase activity and levels of radioiodine uptake were determined after application of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor to GSK5182-treated cells. Finally, the cytotoxic effect of (131)I was determined by clonogenic assay.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Treatment with GSK5182 resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in iodide uptake in ATC cells, which were accompanied by both the downregulation of ERRŒ≥ protein and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Both the increased radioiodine uptake and ERK1/2 activation of ATC cells were completely inhibited by the specific MEK inhibitor. GSK5182 treatment enhanced the membrane localization of NIS in both ATC cell lines. Accordingly, preexposure to GSK5182 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of (131)I treatment in ATC cells.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>These findings suggest that the inverse agonist of ERRŒ≥ enhances the responsiveness of radioiodine therapy by modulating NIS function in ATC cells via the regulation of ERRŒ≥ and the MAP kinase signaling pathway.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
3102532,"In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo determination of thyroid hormone modulating activity of benzothiazoles","As in¬†vitro assays are increasingly used to screen chemicals for their potential to produce endocrine disrupting adverse effects, it is important to understand their predictive capacity. The potential for a set of 6 benzothiazoles to affect endpoints related to thyroid hormone synthesis inhibition were assessed using in¬†vitro, ex vivo, and in¬†vivo assays. Inhibition of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) derived from pig thyroid glands was determined for benzothiazole (BTZ), 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), 5-chloro-2-mercaptobenzothiazole (CMBT), 2-aminobenzothiazole (ABT), 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (HBT), and 2-methylthiobenzothiazole (MTBT). Their rank order potency for TPO inhibition was MBT=CMBT>ABT>BTZ, whereas HBT and MTBT exhibited no inhibitory activity. The benzothiazoles were tested further in a Xenopus laevis thyroid gland explant culture assay in which inhibition of thyroxine (T4) release was the measured endpoint. In this assay all 6 benzothiazoles inhibited T4 release. The activity of the benzothiazoles for disrupting thyroid hormone activity was verified in¬†vivo using X. laevis tadpoles in a 7-day assay. The 2 most potent chemicals for TPO inhibition, MBT and CMBT, produced responses in¬†vivo indicative of T4 synthesis inhibition including induction of sodium iodide symporter mRNA and decreases in glandular and circulating thyroid hormones. The capability to measure thyroid hormone levels in the glands and blood by ultrahigh performance LC-MS/MS methods optimized for small tissue samples was critical for effects interpretation. These results indicate that inhibition of TPO activity in¬†vitro was a good indicator of a chemical's potential for thyroid hormone disruption in¬†vivo and may be useful for prioritizing chemicals for further investigation.",Pilots,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

By using different cell lines derived from tissues specialized on TTR synthesis, such as the hepatocyte and the choroid plexus expressing WT, V30M, or L12P TTR variants we analyzed secretion, intracellular aggregation and degradation patterns. Also, we used liver-specific AAV gene transfer to assess expression of the L12P variant in vivo. We found the following: (i) decreased secretion with intracellular aggregation of TTR L12P in hepatoma cells relative to WT and V30M variant; this differential property of TTR L12P variant was also observed in mice injected with L12P AAV vector; (ii) differential N-glycosylation pattern of L12P variant in hepatoma cell lysates, conditioned media and mouse sera, which might represent an escape mechanism from ERAD degradation; (iii) intracellular L12P TTR aggregates mainly localized to lysosomes in cultured cells and liver; and (iv) none of the above findings were present in choroid plexus derived cells, suggesting particular secretion/quality control mechanisms that might contribute to leptomeningeal amyloidosis associated with the L12P variant. These observations open new avenues for the treatment of TTR associated leptomeningeal amyloidosis.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8583983,Aortic stenosis and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis: the chicken or the egg?,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Aortic stenosis (AS) and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (TTR-CA) are both frequent in elderly. The combination of these two diseases has never been investigated.<br /><br /><strong>AIMS: </strong>To describe patients with concomitant AS and TTR-CA.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Six cardiologic French centres identified retrospectively cases of patients with severe or moderate AS associated with TTR-CA hospitalized during the last 6 years.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Sixteen patients were included. Mean ± SD age was 79 ± 6 years, 81% were men. Sixty per cent were NYHA III-IV, 31% had carpal tunnel syndrome, and 56% had atrial fibrillation. Median (Q1;Q4) NT-proBNP was 4382 (2425;4730) pg/mL and 91% had elevated cardiac troponin level. Eighty-eight per cent had severe AS (n = 14/16), of whom 86% (n = 12) had low-gradient AS. Mean ± SD interventricular septum thickness was 18 ± 4 mm. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and global LS were 50 ± 13% and -7 ± 4%, respectively. Diagnosis of TTR-CA was histologically proven in 38%, and was based on strong cardiac uptake of the tracer at biphosphonate scintigraphy in the rest. Eighty-one per cent had wild-type TTR-CA (n = 13), one had mutated Val122I and 19% did not had genetic test (n = 3). Valve replacement was surgical in 63% and via transcatheter in 13%. Median follow-up in survivors was 33 (16;65) months. Mortality was of 44% (n = 7) during the whole follow-up period.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Combination of AS and TTR-CA may occur in elderly patients particularly those with a low-flow low-gradient AS pattern and carries bad prognosis.

The main component of the underlying pathologic substrate, i.e. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, is misfolded alpha-synuclein (Asyn), and--in particular in demented LBD patients--co-occurring misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta). Lowered blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of transthyretin (TTR)--a clearance protein mainly produced in the liver and, autonomously, in the choroid plexus--are associated with Abeta accumulation in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, a recent study suggests that TTR is involved in Asyn clearance. We measured TTR protein levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of 131 LBD patients (77 PDND, 26 PDD, and 28 DLB) and 72 controls, and compared TTR levels with demographic and clinical data as well as neurodegenerative markers in the CSF. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms of the TTR gene which are considered to influence the ability of the protein to carry its ligands were also analyzed. CSF TTR levels were significantly higher in LBD patients compared to controls. Post-hoc analysis demonstrated that this effect was driven by PDND patients. In addition, CSF TTR levels correlated negatively with CSF Abeta(1-42), total tau and phospho-tau levels. Serum TTR levels did not significantly differ among the studied groups. There were no relevant associations between TTR levels and genetic, demographic and clinical data, respectively. These results suggest an involvement of the clearance protein TTR in LBD pathophysiology, and should motivate to elucidate TTR-related mechanisms in LBD in more detail.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8584012,Measurement of myocardial amyloid deposition in systemic amyloidosis: insights from cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Cardiac involvement in systemic amyloidosis is caused by the extracellular deposition of misfolded proteins, mainly immunoglobulin light chains (AL) or transthyretin (ATTR), and may be detected by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). The aim of this study was to measure myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) in amyloid patients with a novel T1 mapping CMR technique and to determine the correlation between ECV and disease severity.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Thirty-six patients with biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis (mean age 70 ± 9 years, 31 men, 30 with AL and six with ATTR amyloidosis) and seven patients with possible amyloidosis (mean age 64 ± 10 years, six men) underwent comprehensive clinical and CMR assessment, with ECV estimation from pre- and postcontrast T1 mapping. Thirty healthy subjects (mean age 39 ± 17 years, 21 men) served as the control group.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Amyloid patients presented with left ventricular (LV) concentric hypertrophy with impaired biventricular systolic function. Cardiac ECV was higher in amyloid patients (definite amyloidosis, 0.43 ± 0.12; possible amyloidosis, 0.34 ± 0.11) than in control subjects (0.26 ± 0.04, P < 0.05); even in amyloid patients without late gadolinium enhancement (0.35 ± 0.10), ECV was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.01). A cut-off value of myocardial ECV >0.316, corresponding to the 95th percentile in normal subjects, showed a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 97% for discriminating amyloid patients from control subjects (area under the curve of 0.884). Myocardial ECV was significantly correlated with LV ejection fraction (R(2)  = 0.16), LV mean wall thickness (R(2)  = 0.41), LV diastolic function (R(2)  = 0.21), right ventricular ejection fraction (R(2)  = 0.13), N-terminal fragment of the pro-brain natriuretic peptides (R(2)  = 0.23) and cardiac troponin (R(2)  = 0.33).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Myocardial ECV was increased in amyloid patients and correlated with disease severity.

8584014,Transcriptome analysis of grey and white matter cortical tissue in multiple system atrophy,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a distinct member of a group of neurodegenerative diseases known as α-synucleinopathies, which are characterized by the presence of aggregated α-synuclein in the brain. MSA is unique in that the principal site for α-synuclein deposition is in the oligodendrocytes rather than neurons. The cause of MSA is unknown, and the pathogenesis of MSA is still largely speculative. Brain transcriptome perturbations during the onset and progression of MSA are mostly unknown. Using RNA sequencing, we performed a comparative transcriptome profiling analysis of the grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of the frontal cortex of MSA and control brains. The transcriptome sequencing revealed increased expression of the alpha and beta haemoglobin genes in MSA WM, decreased expression of the transthyretin (TTR) gene in MSA GM and numerous region-specific long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). In contrast, we observed only moderate changes in the expression patterns of the α-synuclein (SNCA) gene, which confirmed previous observations by other research groups. Our study suggests that at the transcriptional level, MSA pathology may be related to increased iron levels in WM and perturbations of the non-coding fraction of the transcriptome.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Here, we aimed to clarify the usefulness of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a prognostic marker of cardiac function in SSA and in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP).<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>We studied 13 patients with severe SSA and 14 patients with FAP. SSA patients, but not FAP patients, demonstrated a significant correlation of log BNP with the echocardiographic diastolic marker E/e' ratio (r = 0.78, p < 0.01). SSA patients also showed significant correlations between log BNP and log C-reactive protein or log high-sensitive troponin T (r = 0.70, p < 0.01; r = 0.64, p < 0.05). FAP patients, however, had significant correlations between log BNP and left ventricular wall thickness (intraventricular septum thickness diastole and posterior wall thickness diastole) (r = 0.73, p < 0.01; r = 0.77, p < 0.01). The mean log BNP level in the follow-up period was significantly higher than that in the diagnostic period in SSA patients (2.65 ± 0.45 versus 2.36 ± 0.40, p < 0.01) but not in FAP patients (1.91 ± 0.56 versus 1.93 ± 0.45, p = 0.87).

8584019,Diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) in the treatment of MCT8 deficiency,"<strong>CONTEXT: </strong>Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a thyroid hormone-specific cell membrane transporter. MCT8 deficiency causes severe psychomotor retardation and abnormal thyroid tests. The great majority of affected children cannot walk or talk, and all have elevated serum T(3) levels, causing peripheral tissue hypermetabolism and inability to maintain weight. Treatment with thyroid hormone is ineffective. In Mct8-deficient mice, the thyroid hormone analog, diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), does not require MCT8 to enter tissues and could be an effective alternative to thyroid hormone treatment in humans.<br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect and efficacy of DITPA in children with MCT8 deficiency.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>This was a multicenter report of four affected children given DITPA on compassionate grounds for 26-40 months. Treatment was initiated at ages 8.5-25 months, beginning with a small dose of 1.8 mg, increasing to a maximal 30 mg/d (2.1-2.4 mg/kg · d), given in three divided doses.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg · d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The following significant changes were also observed: decline in SHBG (in all subjects), heart rate (in three of four), and ferritin (in one of four). Cholesterol increased in two subjects. There was no weight loss and weight gain occurred in two. None of the treated children required a gastric feeding tube or developed seizures. No adverse effects were observed.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>DITPA (1-2 mg/kg · d) almost completely normalizes thyroid tests and reduces the hypermetabolism and the tendency for weight loss.

8584023,Identification and characterization of Aβ peptide interactors in Alzheimer's disease by structural approaches,"Currently, there are very limited pharmaceutical interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to alleviate the amyloid burden implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease. Alzheimer's disease is characterized immunohistologically by the accumulation of senile plaques in the brain with afflicted patients progressively losing short-term memory and, ultimately, cognition. Although significant improvements in clinical diagnosis and care for AD patients have been made, effective treatments for this devastating disease remain elusive. A key component of the amyloid burden of AD comes from accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide which comes from processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by enzymes termed secretases, leading to production of these toxic Aβ peptides of 40-42 amino acids. New therapeutic approaches for reducing Aβ are warranted after the most logical avenues of inhibiting secretase activity appear less than optimal in ameliorating the progression of AD.Novel therapeutics may be gleaned from proteomics biomarker initiatives to yield detailed molecular interactions of enzymes and their potential substrates. Explicating the APPome by deciphering protein complexes forming in cells is a complementary approach to unveil novel molecular interactions with the amyloidogenic peptide precursor to both understand the biology and develop potential upstream drug targets. Utilizing these strategies we have identified EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15), a zinc metalloprotease related to neprilysin (NEP), with the ability to catabolize Aβ 1-42 by examining first potential in silico docking and then verification by mass spectrometry. In addition, a hormone carrier protein, transthyreitin (TTR), was identified and with its abundance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), found to clear Aβ by inhibiting formation of oligomeric forms of Aβ peptide. The confluence of complementary strategies may allow new therapeutic avenues as well as biomarkers for AD that will aid in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Although Oatp1a4 (Slco1a4) and Oatp1c1 (Slco1c1) are known to be expressed in the abluminal and luminal membrane of the rat BBB and Oatp1a4 is known to be expressed at the BRB, the expression and localization of Oatp1c1 at the BRB and subcellular localization of Oatp1a4 at the BRB have received little attention. Therefore, the purpose of present study was to determine the cellular and subcellular localization of Oatp1a4 and 1c1 at the BRB.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>We used guinea pig polyclonal antibodies to Oatp1a4 and 1c1 for immunoblot and immunohistochemical analysis to determine their cellular and subcellular distributions in the rat retina. We compared these distributions with those of the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1/Slc2a1). Whole brain, brain capillary fractions and kidney were used as control.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Oatp1a4 and 1c1 immunoreactivities were detected in the rat retinal capillaries and co-localized with GLUT1, suggesting that both proteins are located on the abluminal and luminal membrane of the retinal capillary endothelial cells. Oatp1a4 and 1c1 immunoreactivities were preferentially detected on the apical and basolateral membrane of rat retinal pigment epithelial cells, respectively, suggesting that Oatp1a4 and 1c1 are localized on the apical membrane and the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelial cells, respectively.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Oatp1a4 and 1c1 are present at the BRB and contribute to the transcellular transport of amphipathic organic anions across the BRB.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8624015,"Radiofrequency fields, transthyretin, and Alzheimer's disease","Radiofrequency field (RF) exposure provided cognitive benefits in an animal study. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, exposure reduced brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition through decreased aggregation of Abeta and increase in soluble Abeta levels. Based on our studies on humans on RF from wireless phones, we propose that transthyretin (TTR) might explain the findings. In a cross-sectional study on 313 subjects, we used serum TTR as a marker of cerebrospinal fluid TTR. We found a statistically significantly positive beta coefficient for TTR for time since first use of mobile phones and desktop cordless phones combined (P=0.03). The electromagnetic field parameters were similar for the phone types. In a provocation study on 41 persons exposed for 30 min to an 890-MHz GSM signal with specific absorption rate of 1.0 Watt/kg to the temporal area of the brain, we found statistically significantly increased serum TTR 60 min after exposure. In our cross-sectional study, use of oral snuff also yielded statistically significantly increased serum TTR concentrations and nicotine has been associated with decreased risk for AD and to upregulate the TTR gene in choroid plexus but not in the liver, another source of serum TTR. TTR sequesters Abeta, thereby preventing the formation of Abeta plaques in the brain. Studies have shown that patients with AD have lowered TTR concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and have attributed the onset of AD to insufficient sequestering of Abeta by TTR.

8584049,Genetic analysis of genes involved in amyloid-β degradation and clearance in Alzheimer's disease,"Accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients has been postulated to reflect defects in Aβ degradation or clearance. Here, we selected 12 genes (MMEL1, ECE1, ECE2, AGER, PLG, PLAT, NR1H3, MMP3, LRP1, TTR, NR1H2, and MMP9) involved in Aβ catabolism on the basis of PubMed-based literature search and elucidated their genetic role in AD among Finnish case-control cohort consisting of total ∼1,300 AD patients and control subjects. Thirty one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for genotyping. In a smaller subset of AD patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ42 (n = 124), total-tau (n = 59), and phospho-tau (n = 54) analyses were performed with respect to SNPs. Moreover, age of onset analyses with respect to the studied SNPs were conducted among the AD patient cohort (n = 642). Association analysis of the liver X receptor α (NR1H3) gene SNPs showed a protective effect for C allele carriers of rs7120118 (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.93), while the total-tau and phospho-tau levels in CSF were decreased in AD patients carrying the C allele. Also, a decrease in the age of onset was observed in AD patients carrying the A allele of rs723744 and the C allele of rs3794884 in transthyretin (TTR) gene. However, after adjusting the p-values for multiple comparisons, these results were not statistically significant, suggesting that genetic variations in MMEL1, ECE1, ECE2, AGER, PLG, PLAT, NR1H3, MMP3, LRP1, TTR, NR1H2, and MMP9 genes do not play major role among the Finnish AD patient cohort.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584053,Isolated atrial amyloidosis and the importance of molecular classification,"Amyloid is identified microscopically as an amorphous extracellular hyaline material that exhibits ""apple-green"" birefringence with Congo red stains. Amyloid is not a chemically distinct entity, and currently available molecular methods are capable of identifying over 20 amyloidogenic precursor proteins. Some of the more common diseases associated with amyloidosis include plasma cell dyscrasias, chronic inflammatory disorders, hereditary-familial mutations involving transthyretin, Alzheimer's disease, and so-called ""senile"" or age-related amyloidosis. The amyloid deposits in these various diseases may be isolated to a single organ such as the heart or brain, or the amyloidosis may be systemic. The senile types of cardiac amyloidosis can result from overproduction of atrial natriuretic factor or from accumulation of otherwise normal or wild-type transthyretin. We present the case of an 83-year-old hospitalized woman with known atrial fibrillation and previous pacemaker implantation who had cardiac arrest unresponsive to attempted resuscitation. Autopsy disclosed prominent amyloidosis involving the left atrium, and subsequent molecular studies identified the amyloidogenic material as alpha atrial natriuretic factor.

Polyneuropathy is often a major manifestation of FAP. Although FAP was considered to be an endemic disorder, the advanced biochemical and molecular genetic analyses have shown worldwide occurrence. More than 100 different points of single or double mutations, or a deletion in the TTR gene, have been reported, and several different phenotypes of FAP have been documented, even for the same mutation in the TTR gene. Liver transplantation, which stops the production of amyloidogenic TTR in blood and replaces it with normal TTR, has been considered as an acceptable treatment for FAP.

8584060,Increased expression of axogenesis-related genes and mossy fibre length in dentate granule cells from adult HuD overexpressor mice,"The neuronal RNA-binding protein HuD plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of short-lived mRNAs during the initial establishment and remodelling of neural connections. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing this protein (HuD-Tg) in adult DGCs (dentate granule cells) and shown that their mossy fibres contain high levels of GAP-43 (growth-associated protein 43) and exhibit distinct morphological and electrophysiological properties. To investigate the basis for these changes and identify other molecular targets of HuD, DGCs from HuD-Tg and control mice were collected by LCM (laser capture microscopy) and RNAs analysed using DNA microarrays. Results show that 216 known mRNAs transcripts and 63 ESTs (expressed sequence tags) are significantly up-regulated in DGCs from these transgenic mice. Analyses of the 3'-UTRs (3'-untranslated regions) of these transcripts revealed an increased number of HuD-binding sites and the presence of several known instability-conferring sequences. Among these, the mRNA for TTR (transthyretin) shows the highest level of up-regulation, as confirmed by qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR) and ISH (in situ hybridization). GO (gene ontology) analyses of up-regulated transcripts revealed a large over-representation of genes associated with neural development and axogenesis. In correlation with these gene expression changes, we found an increased length of the infrapyramidal mossy fibre bundle in HuD-Tg mice.

Our results showed that eight protein peaks were down-regulated or up-regulated during the acute phase, and returned toward the control values during the recovery phase. In particular, a 13,761Da protein peak was markedly down-regulated during the acute phase, and returned during the recovery phase. This protein was identified as unmodified transthyretin using two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by peptide mass fingerprinting based on matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). However, we failed to show transthyretin changes with the treatment using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and two-dimensional electrophoresis. The distinction between unmodified and modified subtypes of transthyretin was difficult with these methods because of similar molecular weights and isoelectric points in these subtypes. The present study showed that the application of SELDI-TOF-MS technology has higher precision for the distinction of detailed molecular weight than conventional proteomics techniques such as ELISA and two-dimensional electrophoresis.

The mechanism that induces abnormal behavior such as undressing or hiding during the state of hypothermia has not been clarified. In order to solve these problems, we made a rat model of fatal hypothermia and investigated the expression of some mRNA within the hypothalamus and the frontal cortex. The expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family, member A1 (ALDH6A1), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTPT), desmin (DES), heat shock 70kDa protein 4 (HSPA4), serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A), opioid receptor, delta 1 (OPRD1) and transthyretin (TTR) supposedly related to fatal hypothermia was determined using quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of OPRD1 in the hypothalamus of fatal hypothermia was significantly increased, while the expression of TTR within the frontal cortex was significantly decreased compared to that in the control. These findings suggest that OPRD1 and TTR may be involved in thermoregulation at a low ambient temperature.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584082,Primary and secondary thyroid hormone transporters,"Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for the development of the human brain, growth and cellular metabolism. Investigation of TH transporters became one of the emerging fields in thyroid research after the discovery of inactivating mutations in the Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), which was found to be highly specific for TH transport. However, additional transmembrane transporters are also very important for TH uptake and efflux in different cell types. They transport TH as secondary substrates and include the aromatic amino acid transporting MCT10, the organic anion transporting polypeptides (e.g. OATP1C1, OATP1A2, OPTP1A4) and the large neutral amino acid transporters (LAT1 and LAT2). These TH transporters characteristically possess 12 transmembrane spanners but due to the strong differing sequences between the three transporter families we assume an identical conformation is not very likely. In contrast to the others, the LAT family members form a heterodimer with the escort protein 4F2hc/CD98. A comparison of sequence proportions, locations and types of functional sensitive features for TH transport discovered by mutations, revealed that transport sensitive charged residues occur as conserved amino acids only within each family of the transporter types but not in all putative TH transporters. Based on the lack of highly conserved sensitive charged residues throughout the three transporter families as a common counterpart for the amino acid moiety of the substrates, we conclude that the molecular transport mechanism is likely organized either a) by different molecular determinants in the divergent transporter types or b) the counterparts for the substrates` amino acid moiety at the transporter are not any charged side chains but other proton acceptors or donators. However, positions of transport sensitive residues coincide at transmembrane helix 8 in the TH transporter MCT8, OATP1C1 and another amino acid transporter, the L-cystine and L-glutamate exchanger xCT, which is highly homologous to LAT1 and LAT2. Here we review the data available and compare similarities and differences between these primary and secondary TH transporters regarding sequences, topology, potential structures, trafficking to the plasma membrane, molecular features and locations of transport sensitive functionalities. Thereby, we focus on TH transporters occurring in the blood-brain barrier.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In total, we have identified 66 protein spots in human plasma and found that seven of them showed altered changes in schizophrenia patients, as compared to healthy controls, which mainly were acute phase proteins (APPs). Among these APPs, haptoglobin alpha2 chain (p < 0.001), haptoglobin beta chain (p < 0.001), alpha1-antitrypsin (p = 0.001), and complement factor B precursor (p = 0.022) showed overexpression in schizophrenia patients, whereas apolipoprotein A-I (p = 0.034) and transthyretin (p = 0.035) were found to be significantly decreased in patients. In addition, the expression of apolipoprotein A-IV (p = 0.018) was significantly up-regulated in schizophrenia patients, as compared to controls.

A growing body of evidence suggests transthyretin (TTR) as an important modulator of AD pathogenesis. Aiming at providing further insight into the potential neuroprotective role of TTR and gender differences in AD, we crossed transgenic AβPPswe/PS1A246E mice with TTR-null mice and investigated both male and female AβPPswe/PS1A246E/TTR+/+, AβPPswe/PS1A246E/TTR+/-, and AβPPswe/PS1A246E/TTR-/- animals for brain amyloid-β (Aβ) levels and deposition. The levels of circulating TTR between non-transgenic and AD mice were evaluated. Decreased levels of circulating TTR in AD mice as compared to non-transgenic littermates were observed in early stages of AD-like neuropathology, but not at later stages where an opposite relationship was found. Elevated brain levels of Aβ42 were observed in AβPPswe/PS1A246E/TTR+/- female mice as compared to AβPPswe/PS1A246E/TTR+/+ female littermates; no significant differences were found among males of different TTR genotypes. We subsequently quantified the brain levels of testosterone and 17β-estradiol in these animals and verified that AβPPswe/PS1A246E/TTR+/- female mice present reduced brain levels of both hormones as compared to AβPPswe/PS1A246E/TTR+/+ females; no significant differences were detected among males of different TTR genotypes. Our results provide evidence for a gender-associated modulation of brain Aβ levels and brain sex steroid hormones by TTR, and suggest that reduced levels of brain testosterone and 17β-estradiol in female mice with TTR genetic reduction might underlie their increased AD-like neuropathology.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

Although the amyloid-beta peptide is by far the commonest amyloid subunit implicated in sporadic and rarely in hereditary forms of CAA, a number of other proteins may also be involved in rare familial diseases in which CAA is also a characteristic morphological feature. These latter proteins include the ABri and ADan subunits in familial British dementia and familial Danish dementia, respectively, which are also known under the umbrella term BRI2 gene-related dementias, variant cystatin C in hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with amyloidosis of Icelandic-type, variant transthyretins in meningo-vascular amyloidosis, disease-associated prion protein (PrP(Sc)) in hereditary prion disease with premature stop codon mutations and mutated gelsolin (AGel) in familial amyloidosis of Finnish type.

A rare phenotype, called hereditary leptomeningeal TTR amyloidosis, in which TTR amyloid deposition occurs mainly in leptomeninges and subarachnoid vessels, has been reported in patients with several different TTR variants. In the present study, we examined TTR variants immunoprecipitated from the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with hereditary leptomeningeal TTR amyloidosis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IP-Mass method). The leptomeningeal-type TTR variants were not detected in the serum but were found at low levels in the CSF. The undetectable levels of the leptomeningeal-type TTR variants in serum could explain the minute amounts of systemic deposition of these variants. The relatively high level of unstable TTR variants in CSF, probably due to increased secretion from the choroid plexus, is considered to be the pathogenesis of the leptomeningeal-type of TTR amyloidosis.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a system linked to the brain and its composition can be altered not only by encephalic disorder, but also by systemic diseases such as arterial hypertension, which produces alterations in the choroid plexus and cerebrospinal fluid protein composition. 2D gel electrophoresis in cerebrospinal fluid extracted from the cistern magna before sacrifice of hypertensive and control rats was performed. The results showed different proteomic profiles between SHR and WKY, that α-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A1, albumin, immunoglobulin G, vitamin D binding protein, haptoglobin and α-1-macroglobulin were found to be up-regulated in SHR, and apolipoprotein E, transthyretin, α-2-HS-glycoprotein, transferrin, α-1β-glycoprotein, kininogen and carbonic anhidrase II were down-regulated in SHR.

TTR is mainly synthesized in liver, choroid plexuses of brain and pancreas and secreted to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although it possesses a sequon for N-glycosylation N-D-S at position 98, it is not secreted as a glycoprotein. The most common FAP-associated mutation is TTR V30M. In a screening for monoclonal antibodies developed against an amyloidogenic TTR form, we detected a distinct TTR with slower electrophoretic mobility in Western of plasma from carriers of the V30M mutation, not present in normal plasma. Mass spectrometry analyses of this slower migrating TTR (SMT) identified both wild-type and mutant V30M; SMT was undetectable upon N-glycosidase F treatment. Furthermore, SMT readily disappeared in the plasma of V30M - FAP patients after liver transplantation and appeared in plasma of transplanted domino individuals that received a V30M liver. SMT was also detected in plasma, but not in CSF of transgenic mice for the human V30M mutation. A hepatoma cell line transduced to express human V30M did not present the SMT modification in secretion media. Glycosylated TTR was absent in fibrils extracted from human kidney V30M autopsy tissue or in TTR aggregates extracted from the intestine of human TTR transgenic mice.

Clinicopathological and genetic features,"Clinicopathological and genetic features were assessed on 35 Japanese families affected by late-onset familial amyloid polyneuropathy type I (transthyretin Met30-associated familial amyloid polyneuropathy, FAP TTR Met30) whose siblings were unrelated to endemic Japanese foci. In these patients (50 years or older), the most common initial symptom was paraesthesias in the legs. Autonomic symptoms were generally mild and did not seriously affect daily activities. The male-to-female ratio was extremely high (10.7 : 1). A family history was evident in only 11 out of 35 families, and other patients were apparently sporadic. The rate of penetrance was very low. Symptomatic siblings of familial cases showed a late age of onset, male preponderance and clinical features similar to those of the probands. Asymptomatic carriers, predominantly female, were detected relatively late in life. The geographical distribution of these late-onset, FAP TTR Met30 cases was scattered throughout Japan. In three autopsy cases and 20 sural nerve biopsy specimens, neurons in sympathetic and sensory ganglia were relatively preserved. Amyloid deposition was seen in the peripheral nervous system, particularly in the sympathetic ganglia, dorsal root ganglia and proximal nerve trunks such as sciatic nerve. These abnormalities were milder than those seen in typical early-onset FAP TTR Met30, as observed in two Japanese endemic foci of this disease. While axonal degeneration was prominent in myelinated fibres, resulting in severe fibre loss, unmyelinated fibres were relatively preserved.

Existing brain amyloid measurement techniques, such as the Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid, are not reasonable first-line approaches limited by either feasibility or cost.<br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>We aimed to identify simple and cost-effective rules that can predict brain Aβ level by integrating both neuropsychological measurements and blood-based markers.<br /><br /><strong>METHOD: </strong>Several decision tree models were built for extracting the predictive rules based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>We successfully extracted predictive rules of Aβ level. For cognitive function variables, cases above the 45th percentile in total cognitive score (TOTALMOD), above the 52nd percentile of delayed word recall, and above the 70th percentile in orientation resulted in a group that was highly enriched for amyloid negative cases. Conversely scoring below the 15th percentile of TOTALMOD resulted in a group highly enriched for amyloid positive cases. For blood protein markers, scoring below the 57th percentile for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels (irrespective of genotype) enriched two fold for the risk of being amyloid positive. In the high ApoE cases, scoring above the 60th percentile for transthyretin resulted in a group that was >90% amyloid negative. A third decision tree using both cognitive and blood-marker data slightly improved the classification of cases.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Our study demonstrated that the integration of the neuropsychological measurements and blood-based markers significantly improved prediction accuracy.

FAP was considered a rare endemic disease; however, its worldwide incidence is much higher than previously recognized. Until recently, liver transplantation was the only effective treatment for FAP. However, liver transplantation has a number of limitations, including a shortage of donors and a requirement for surgery for both the recipient and living donor. Furthermore, a large number of the patients are not good transplant candidates because of their age and/or advanced disease status.

8583620,The molecular mechanism of intestinal levodopa absorption and its possible implications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease,"Levodopa (L-DOPA) is the naturally occurring precursor amino acid for dopamine and the main therapeutic agent for neurologic disorders due to dopamine depletion, such as Parkinson's disease. l-DOPA absorption in small intestine has been suggested to be mediated by the large neutral amino acids transport machinery, but the identity of the involved transporters is unknown. Clinically, coadministration of l-DOPA and dietary amino acids is avoided to decrease competition for transport in intestine and at the blood-brain barrier. l-DOPA is routinely coadministered with levodopa metabolism inhibitors (dopa-decarboxylase and cathechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors) that share structural similarity with levodopa. In this systematic study involving Xenopus laevis oocytes and Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelia expression systems and ex vivo preparations from wild-type and knockout mice, we identified the neutral and dibasic amino acids exchanger (antiporter) b(0,+)AT-rBAT (SLC7A9-SLC3A1) as the luminal intestinal l-DOPA transporter. The major luminal cotransporter (symporter) B(0)AT1 (SLC6A19) was not involved in levodopa transport. L-Leucine and L-arginine competed with levodopa across the luminal enterocyte membrane as expected for b(0,+)AT-rBAT substrates, whereas dopa-decarboxylase and cathechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors had no effect. The presence of amino acids in the basolateral compartment mimicking the postprandial phase increased transepithelial levodopa transport by stimulating basolateral efflux via the antiporter LAT2-4F2 (SLC7A8-SLC3A2). Additionally, the aromatic amino acid uniporter TAT1 (SLC16A10) was shown to play a major role in l-DOPA efflux from intestinal enterocytes.

8583628,[Classification of amyloidosis],"Amyloidoses are a group of protein conformational diseases in which soluble precursor proteins form insoluble amyloid fibrils in the extracellular space. Amyloidoses are roughly classified in terms of their localized or systemic deposition, and are further grouped based on the types of precursor proteins. As of today, 27 different proteins have been recognized as amyloid precursor proteins. Amyloidoses are diagnosed by histopathological analysis using Congo red staining and/or electron microscopy, and the disease classification is made based on immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and gene analyses. The four main types of systemic amyloidosis are light-chain amyloidosis, reactive amyloid A amyloidosis due to chronic inflammatory diseases, β2-microglobulin amyloidosis associated with long-term hemodialysis, and hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis caused by mutations in the transthyretin gene. There are a many types of localized amyloidosis including cerebral endocrine, and cutaneous amyloidosis.

8583692,The role of L-type amino acid transporters in the uptake of glyphosate across mammalian epithelial tissues,"Glyphosate is one of the most commonly used herbicides worldwide due to its broad spectrum of activity and reported low toxicity to humans. Glyphosate has an amino acid-like structure that is highly polar and shows low bioavailability following oral ingestion and low systemic toxicity following intravenous exposures. Spray applications of glyphosate in agricultural or residential settings can result in topical or inhalation exposures to the herbicide. Limited systemic exposure to glyphosate occurs following skin contact, and pulmonary exposure has also been reported to be low. The results of nasal inhalation exposures, however, have not been evaluated. To investigate the mechanisms of glyphosate absorption across epithelial tissues, the permeation of glyphosate across Caco-2 cells, a gastrointestinal epithelium model, was compared with permeation across nasal respiratory and olfactory tissues excised from cows. Saturable glyphosate uptake was seen in all three tissues, indicating the activity of epithelial transporters. The uptake was shown to be ATP and Na(+) independent, and glyphosate permeability could be significantly reduced by the inclusion of competitive amino acids or specific LAT1/LAT2 transporter inhibitors. The pattern of inhibition of glyphosate permeability across Caco-2 and nasal mucosal tissues suggests that LAT1/2 play major roles in the transport of this amino-acid-like herbicide. Enhanced uptake into the epithelial cells at barrier mucosae, including the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, may result in more significant local and systemic effects than predicted from glyphosate's passive permeability, and enhanced uptake by the olfactory mucosa may result in further CNS disposition, potentially increasing the risk for brain-related toxicities.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
8583695,Transthyretin as a new transporter of nanoparticles for receptor-mediated transcytosis in rat brain microvessels,"Many drugs are unable to breach the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Protein-directed transport of nanomedicine by receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) has been investigated as a means to overcome this problem. In this study, we screened transporters using an in vitro transcytosis assay system in rat serum to identify candidates that could guide nanoparticles through the BBB by RMT. The proteins that showed over 5-fold decreases in RMT when treated with chloropromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, were selected and identified by Maldi-TOF mass spectroscopy. Eleven proteins, including transthyretin (Ttr), and creatine kinase-muscle type (CKM), were identified as being capable of penetrating the endothelial cell layer by RMT. Among them, 10 proteins have not yet been used to transport nanomaterials across the BBB. To validate their activity as nanoparticle transporters in vivo, Ttr and CKM were conjugated to the surface of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles and administrated intravenously. After 8h, the distribution of Ttr-QDs and CKM-QDs in brain tissue was analyzed. The results showed transcytosis of Ttr-QD conjugates across the BBB in rats as well as in in vitro assays, which was in contrast to the results observed for bare QDs and CKM-QDs. Taken together, these results indicate that Ttr is a new putative transporter for nanomedicines across the BBB.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The main constituents of amyloid fibrils are atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the N-terminal part of its precursor form (NT-proANP). An 'aggregation-prone' heptapeptide ((114)KLRALLT(120)) was located within the NT-proANP sequence. This peptide self-assembles into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, as electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy and Congo red staining studies reveal. Consequently, remedies/drugs designed to inhibit the aggregation tendency of this 'aggregation-prone' segment of NT-proANP may assist in prevention/treatment of IAA, congestive heart failure (CHF) or atrial fibrillation (AF).",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Utilizing our neonatal mouse model of infection, we evaluated the consequences of early viral infection upon the host central nervous system (CNS) by comparing CVB3 and LCMV infection. Both viruses expressed high levels of viral protein in the choroid plexus and subventricular zone (SVZ), a region of neurogenesis. LCMV infected a greater number of cells in the SVZ and targeted both nestin(+) (neural progenitor cell marker) and olig2(+) (glial progenitor marker) cells at a relatively equal proportion. In contrast, CVB3 preferentially infected nestin(+) cells within the SVZ. Microarray analysis revealed differential kinetics and unique host gene expression changes for each infection. MHC class I gene expression, several developmental-related Hox genes, and transthyretin (TTR), a protein secreted in the cerebrospinal fluid by the choroid plexus, were specifically downregulated following CVB3 infection. Also, we identified severe pathology in the choroid plexus of CVB3-infected animals at 48 h post infection accompanied by a decrease in the level of TTR and carbonic anhydrase II. These results demonstrate broader neural progenitor and stem cell (NPSC) tropism for LCMV in the neonatal CNS, whereas CVB3 targeted a more specific subset of NPSCs, stimulated a distinct early immune response, and induced significant acute damage in the choroid plexus.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

On the other hand, it is not known whether these transgenic mice show changed natriuretic peptide (NP) expression patterns in the heart. Therefore, we examined the distribution of NPs in the myocardium and the conduction system of transgenic mice overexpressing ANP, as well as in wild-type littermates. The hearts were serially sectioned and processed for immunohistochemistry, with antisera against ANP and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Florescence microscopy was performed for qualitative analysis. Immunoreactivity for ANP and BNP was detected to a similar degree in the conduction system of both transgenic and wild-type mice. The nodal tissues never exhibited immunoreactions for ANP or BNP, whereas Purkinje fibers of the atrioventricular junctional tissue, bundle branches, and the peripheral Purkinje fiber network exhibited specific immunoreactivity. Atrial and ventricular myocytes of both transgenic and wild-type mice exhibited ANP and BNP to a similar extent. This is the first study examining the expression pattern of NPs in the cardiac conduction system of the mouse as well as the pattern of ANP and BNP expression in the conduction system of TTR-ANP transgenic mice and its wild-type siblings.

Increased levels of TTR and activated insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) are associated with reduced neurodegeneration in an AD mouse model. In the present study, we found that TTR and IGF-I have a synergistic effect on activation of one of the IGF-IR signaling pathways. Hippocampus of TTR null mice present decreased levels of phosphorylated IGF-IR and Akt when compared with TTR wild type littermate animals. Cell studies reveal the synergistic effect of TTR and IGF-I in promoting IGF-IR signaling even under glutamate induced toxicity. TTR:IGF-IR complexes are identified and a bio-layer interferometry assay demonstrated an interaction between TTR and IGF-IR with a KD ranging from 99 to 744nM.

8583739,Cognitive and affective dysfunctions in autoimmune thyroiditis,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most frequent cause of hypothyroidism in areas with sufficient iodine intake. While the impact of thyroid function on mood and cognition is well known, only in the recent years, an increasing number of studies report on the association of HT with cognitive and affective disturbances also in the euthyroid state. Recent imaging studies have shown that these impairments are accompanied by altered brain perfusion, in particular, in the frontal lobe and a reduced gray matter density in the left inferior gyrus frontalis. Brain function abnormalities in euthyroid patients with HT may be subtle and only detected by specific testing or even severe as it is the case in the rare neuropsychiatric disorder Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE). The good response to glucocorticoids in patients with HE indicates an autoimmune origin. In line with this, the cognitive deficits and the high psycho-social burden in euthyroid HT patients without apparent signs of encephalopathy appear to be associated with anti-thyroid peroxidase auto-antibody (TPO Abs) levels. Though in vitro studies showing binding of TPO Abs to human cerebellar astrocytes point to a potential direct role of TPO Abs in the pathogenesis of brain abnormalities in HT patients, TPO Abs may function only as a marker of an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system. In line with this, anti-central nervous system auto-antibodies (CNS Abs) which are markedly increased in patients with HT disturb myelinogenesis in vitro and, therefore, may impair myelin sheath integrity. In addition, in HT patients, production of monocyte- and T-lymphocyte-derived cytokines is also markedly increased which may negatively affect multiple neurotransmitters and, consequently, diverse brain neurocircuits.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

One of major functions of BSAT1 (or Oatp1c1) is specific transport of thyroxin across the blood-brain barrier. Female rats of two control groups were injected with non-specific Ig and 0.9% NaCl. The progeny of rats receiving monoclonal antibodies to BSAT1 demonstrated memory impairment in the Y-maze, novel object recognition test, passive avoidance test, and Morris water maze test in comparison with the control group.

8583761,The systemic amyloid precursor transthyretin (TTR) behaves as a neuronal stress protein regulated by HSF1 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and APP23 Alzheimer's disease model mice,"Increased neuronal synthesis of transthyretin (TTR) may favorably impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) because TTR has been shown to inhibit Aβ aggregation and detoxify cell-damaging conformers. The mechanism whereby hippocampal and cortical neurons from AD patients and APP23 AD model mice produce more TTR is unknown. We now show that TTR expression in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, primary hippocampal neurons and the hippocampus of APP23 mice, is significantly enhanced by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated occupation of TTR promoter heat shock elements by HSF1 in APP23 hippocampi, primary murine hippocampal neurons, and SH-SY5Y cells, but not in mouse liver, cultured human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, or AC16 cultured human cardiomyocytes. Treating SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with heat shock or the HSF1 stimulator celastrol increased TTR transcription in parallel with that of HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90. With both treatments, ChIP showed increased occupancy of heat shock elements in the TTR promoter by HSF1. In vivo celastrol increased the HSF1 ChIP signal in hippocampus but not in liver. Transfection of a human HSF1 construct into SH-SY5Y cells increased TTR transcription and protein production, which could be blocked by shHSF1 antisense. The effect is neuron specific. In cultured HepG2 cells, HSF1 was either suppressive or had no effect on TTR expression confirming the differential effects of HSF1 on TTR transcription in different cell types.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) prognostic power, a validated risk score for predicting mortality in CHF, is improved by adding B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). We evaluated in a prospective study the incremental value of several biomarkers, linked to different biological domains, on death risk prediction of BNP-added SHFM.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Troponin I (cTnI), norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, high sensitivity-C reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 2 soluble receptor, leptin, prealbumin, free malondialdehyde, and 15-F2t-isoprostane were measured in plasma from 142 consecutive ambulatory, non-diabetic stable CHF (mean NYHA-class 2.6) patients (mean age 75±8years). Calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification of BNP-added SHFM were evaluated after individual biomarker addition.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Individual addition of biomarkers to BNP-added SHFM did not improve death prediction, except for prealbumin (HR 0.49 CI: (0.31-0.76) p=0.002) and cTnI (HR 2.03 CI: (1.20-3.45) p=0.009). In fact, with respect to BNP-added SHFM (Harrell's C-statistic 0.702), prealbumin emerged as a stronger predictor of death showing the highest improvement in model discrimination (+0.021, p=0.033) and only a trend was observed for cTn I (+0.023, p=0.063). These biomarkers showed also the best reclassification statistic (Integrated Discrimination Improvement-IDI) at 1-year (IDI: cTnI, p=0.002; prealbumin, p=0.020), 2-years (IDI: cTnI, p=0.018; prealbumin: p=0.006) and 3-years of follow-up (IDI: cTnI p=0.024; prealbumin: p=0.012).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Individual addition of prealbumin allows a more accurate prediction of mortality of BNP enriched SHFM in ambulatory elderly CHF suggesting its potential use in identifying those at high-risk that need nutritional surveillance.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8583821,"The influence of ageing in the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of proteins that are  derived from the choroid plexus, brain, and plasma","Studies have shown that ageing alone can cause increases in the concentrations of many cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins. Therefore, CSF protein concentrations must be interpreted with caution before concluding that the increased concentrations of certain proteins can be used as disease-specific biomarkers. Age-related reduction in CSF turnover has been shown to have a significant concentrating effect on CSF proteins from young to old. As a result, CSF protein concentrations need to be corrected with age-specific turnovers first before performing any data comparisons between different ages. This study applied the concept of CSF/plasma concentration ratios of plasma-derived proteins that is frequently used in the investigation of brain barrier integrity to calculate the amount of protein that enters the CSF from the plasma side in different age groups. Based on our calculations, proteins with molecular weights greater than 91.92 kDa for the young, 109.51 kDa for the middle-aged and 120 kDa for the old should not be able to cross the brain barriers of the blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers to enter the CSF from the plasma side. For proteins that can be derived from the choroid plexus (CP), brain, and plasma, the amount that crosses the barriers to enter the CSF from the plasma side will contribute to their measured total protein concentrations in the CSF. CP and brain production of these proteins can be calculated when turnover corrected CSF protein concentrations are further corrected by the amount of protein that crosses the barriers. In this study, CP and brain produced concentrations of transthyretin, retinol binding protein, alpha-1-antitrypsin, gelsolin, and lactotransferrin were calculated. The production of these proteins decreased with age with alpha-1-antitrypsin protein revealing the most substantial decrease of 86% from young (0.14±0.01 mg·dL(-1)) to old (0.02 mg·dL(-1)). In conclusion, measured CSF protein concentrations for proteins that can be derived from the CP, brain, and plasma need to be corrected by age-specific CSF turnovers and by the amount of protein that crosses the brain barriers first before their concentrations can be compared logically between different ages.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8583823,Three novel mutations of the MCT8 (SLC16A2) gene: individual and temporal variations of endocrinological and radiological features,"We performed genetic analysis and clinical investigations for three patients with suspected monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency. On genetic analysis of the MCT8(SLC16A2) gene, novel mutations (c.1333C>A; p.R445S, c.587G>A; p.G196E and c.1063_1064insCTACC; p.R355PfsX64) were identified in each of three patients. Although thyroid function tests (TFTs) showed the typical pattern of MCT8 deficiency at the time of genetic diagnosis in all patients, two patients occasionally were euthyroid. A TRH test revealed low response, exaggerated response and normal response of TSH, respectively. Endocrinological studies showed gonadotropin (Gn) deficiency in two adult patients. On ultrasonography, goiter was detected in one patient. Interestingly, pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated atrophy and thinness of the pituitary gland in two patients. Our findings suggest that thyroid status in patients with MCT8 deficiency varies with time of examination, and repeated TFTs are necessary for patients suspected of MCT8 deficiency before genetic analysis. In addition, it is noteworthy that some variations were observed on the TRH test and ultrasonography of the thyroid gland in the present study.

It is classified into several types according to the cerebrovascular amyloid proteins involved [amyloid β-protein (Aβ), cystatin C (ACys), prion protein (APrP), transthyretin (ATTR), gelsolin (AGel), ABri/ADan, and AL]. Sporadic Aβ-type CAA is commonly found in elderly individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). CAA-related disorders include hemorrhagic and ischemic brain lesions and dementia. It has been proposed that cerebrovascular Aβ originates mainly from the brain and is transported to the vascular wall through a perivascular drainage pathway, where it polymerizes into fibrils on vascular basement membrane through interactions with extracellular components. CAA would be promoted by overproduction of Aβ40 (a major molecular species of cerebrovascular Aβ), a decrease of Aβ degradation, or reduction of Aβ clearance due to impairment of perivascular drainage pathway.

In our aging population transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is common and must be differentiated from other amyloid types. We report the clinical presentation, natural history, and prognostic features of ATTRwt compared with cardiac-isolated AL amyloidosis and calculate the probability of disease diagnosis of ATTRwt from baseline factors.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>All patients with biopsy-proven ATTRwt (102 cases) and isolated cardiac AL (36 cases) seen from 2002 to 2011 at the UK National Amyloidosis Center were included. Median survival from the onset of symptoms was 6.07 years in the ATTRwt group and 1.7 years in the AL group. Positive troponin, a pacemaker, and increasing New York Heart Association (NYHA) class were associated with worse survival in ATTRwt patients on univariate analysis. All patients with isolated cardiac AL and 24.1% of patients with ATTRwt had evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia. Older age and lower N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) were factors significantly associated with ATTRwt. Patients aged 70 years and younger with an NT pro-BNP <183 pmol/L were more likely to have ATTRwt, as were patients older than 70 years with an NT pro-BNP <1420 pmol/L.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Factors at baseline associated with a worse outcome in ATTRwt are positive troponin T, a pacemaker, and NYHA class IV symptoms.

We sought to clarify whether speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) would provide useful information in patients with ATTRm cardiac amyloidosis.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>One hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with ATTRm amyloidosis were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 had no evidence of cardiac involvement (n = 47), group 2 had heart involvement but no congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels < 100 pg/mL (n = 35), and group 3 had heart involvement and CHF and/or serum BNP levels ≥ 100 pg/mL (n = 41).

Cranial MRI showed symmetric thin rims of low signal intensity in T2- and T2*-weighted images in the cortex of the sylvian fissures, of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, and in the quadrigeminal plate consistent with superficial siderosis of the CNS. Her older daughter had vitreal amyloid deposits, acute Brown-Sequard syndrome at C4, acute sensorineural deafness, and recurrent transient neurologic symptoms. Cranial MRI at age 48 revealed a rim of low signal intensity in T2- and T2*-weighted images in the superior vermis folia and the right sylvian cortex. In addition, two small hemosiderin deposits were seen in the left parietal cortex. Lumbar puncture yielded colorless CSF with increased ferritin content and was followed by fourth ventricle hemorrhage. Cranial MRI 11 months later showed progression of brain hemosiderin deposits. The younger daughter had vitreal deposits, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and acute sensorineural hearing but no evidence of siderosis on cranial MRI. She died at age 43 years of posterior fossa subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the neuropathologic examination showed amyloid deposition in the leptomeningeal spaces and vessels.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Transthyretin-related amyloidosis may cause superficial siderosis of the CNS through subarachnoid bleeding related to meningovascular amyloid deposition.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8583842,Pre-analytical factors influencing the stability of cerebrospinal fluid proteins,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a potential source for new biomarkers due to its proximity to the brain. This study aimed to clarify the stability of the CSF proteome when undergoing pre-analytical factors. We investigated the effects of repeated freeze/thaw cycles, protease inhibitors and delayed storage for 4h, 24h or 14 days at -20°C, 4°C and room temperature (RT) after centrifugation compared with our standard practice of two hours at RT before placing the samples in an -80°C environment. The results were obtained using immunoassays for amyloid-beta 1-42 (Aβ42), tau, phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and cystatin C and using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for proteomic profiling. Tau and P-tau were susceptible to repeated freeze/thaw cycles while SELDI-TOF analysis produced eight significant peaks and additional artefact peaks from samples with added protease inhibitors. Delayed storage for different durations and in different temperatures produced six significant SELDI-TOF peaks. Aβ42 and tau were susceptible to increased temperatures and the duration before storage, whereas P-tau and cystatin C were not. Transthyretin and several of its isoforms were found using SELDI-TOF and were susceptible to freeze/thaw cycles and to increased temperature and length of time prior to storage. We recommend that CSF should be collected and centrifuged immediately after sampling and prior to storage at -80°C without the addition of protease inhibitors. Freeze/thawing should be avoided because of the instability of tau, P-tau and transthyretin.

8583941,Growth of embryo and gene expression of nutrient transporters in the small intestine of the domestic pigeon (Columba livia),"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between gene expression of nutrient (amino acid, peptide, sodium and proton) transporters in the small intestine and embryonic growth in domestic pigeons (Columba livia). One hundred and twenty-five fertilized eggs were randomly assigned into five groups and were incubated under optimal conditions (temperature of 38.1 °C and relative humidity of 55%). Twenty embryos/birds from each group were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on embryonic day (E) 9, 11, 13, 15 and day of hatch (DOH). The eggs, embryos (without yolk sac), and organs (head, brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidney, gizzard, small intestine, legs, and thorax) were dissected, cleaned, and weighed. Small intestine samples were collected for RNA isolation. The mRNA abundance of intestinal nutrient transporters was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We classified these ten organs into four types according to the changes in relative weight during embryonic development. In addition, the gene expression of nutrient transporters was differentially regulated by embryonic day. The mRNA abundances of b(0,+)AT, EAAT3, y(+)LAT2, PepT1, LAT4, NHE2, and NHE3 increased linearly with age, whereas mRNA abundances of CAT1, CAT2, LAT1, EAAT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2 were increased to higher levels on E9 or E11 and then decreased to lower levels until DOH. The results of correlation analysis showed that the gene expressions of b(0,+)AT, EAAT3, PepT1, LAT4, NHE2, NHE3, and y(+)LAT2 had positive correlations with body weight (0.71<correlation coefficient (CC)<0.82, P<0.0001), while CAT1, CAT2, EAAT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2 had negative correlations with body weight (-0.86<CC<-0.64, P<0.0001). The gene expressions of b(0,+)AT, EAAT3, LAT4, PepT1, NHE2, NHE3, and y(+)LAT2 showed positive correlations with intestinal weight (0.80<CC<0.91, P<0.0001), while CAT1, CAT2, and EAAT2 showed negative correlations with intestinal weight (-0.84<CC<-0.67, P<0.0001). It was concluded that the differences between growth trajectories of organs and gene expression of nutrient transporters in small intestine were due to their functional and physiological properties, which provided a comprehensive study of amino acid and peptide transporter mRNA in the small intestine during embryonic growth of pigeons.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8583944,Neuropathologic analysis of Tyr69His TTR variant meningovascular amyloidosis with dementia,"Transthyretin/TTR gene mutations usually cause systemic amyloidotic diseases. Few TTR variants preferentially affect the central nervous system, manifesting as oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis. Patients with TTR meningovascular amyloidosis often show dementia, however the neuropathologic features of dementia in these cases have not been elucidated. We report the neuropathologic findings from a brain autopsy of a 72-year-old man with the rare Tyr69His (Y69H) TTR gene variant, dementia and ataxia. Severe amyloid deposits were observed in the leptomeninges and in a subpial and subependymal distribution. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the amyloid deposits were comprised of over 80 % of the variant TTR. TTR was undetectable by mass spectrometry in the neocortex subjacent to the subpial amyloid deposits. Subpial TTR amyloid deposits were associated with brisk superficial reactive gliosis and siderosis in the neocortex and cerebellar cortex. Subependymal TTR amyloid deposits were associated with subjacent myelin pallor in the hippocampal outflow tract structures including the alveus, fimbria and fornix. Phospho-tau immunostains demonstrated transentorhinal-stage neurofibrillary degeneration (Braak stage II) which, in the absence of neocortical amyloid-beta and neuritic plaques, was indicative of primary age-related tauopathy (PART). However, distinctive phospho-tau aggregates were observed subjacent to the subpial TTR amyloid deposits in all regions of the neocortex, including the primary motor and striate cortices, suggesting a potential link between TTR amyloid and neocortical tauopathy.

8583945,Screening for GFAP rearrangements in a cohort of Alexander disease and undetermined leukoencephalopathy patients,"Alexander disease (AxD), a fatal degenerative leukoencephalopathy, is caused by de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) gene. The pathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of Rosenthal fibers, cytoplasmic inclusions in astrocytes, composed mainly of GFAP, αB-crystallin and HSP27. To date, several patients with a typical presentation of the disease or displaying characteristic Rosenthal fibers in brain material have been reported with no GFAP mutation. Recently, several studies have demonstrated a correlation between Rosenthal fiber formation and wild-type GFAP overexpression, despite the absence of mutations. We tested the hypothesis that a GFAP gene rearrangement could modulate AxD severity or promote GFAP overexpression and aggregation, resulting in leukoencephalopathy. A QMPSF assay was validated for 11 exonic fragments: 3 in control genes (CFTR, DSCR1, F9) and 8 corresponding to GFAP exons. A total of 97 patients suspected of AxD were analyzed: 28 with a GFAP mutation; 69 with clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria compatible with the disease. Neither duplications nor deletions of GFAP were found, suggesting that GFAP coding-region rearrangements may not be involved in AxD or Alexander-related leukoencephalopathies. In addition, 80 patients with undetermined leukodystrophies, and negative for PLP1, GJA12, Sox10 and MCT8 mutations and PLP1 and Lamin B1 rearrangements, were tested. These patients were also negative for GFAP rearrangements. Other hypotheses should be investigated for a molecular diagnosis in patients with undetermined leukoencephalopathy: mutations in GFAP isoforms, splicing sites or regulatory regions, or defaults in genes encoding molecular partners of GFAP.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

As SLC16A2 encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), a thyroid hormone transporter, patients with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome present a specific altered thyroid hormone profile. Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome has been associated with myelination delay on the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of affected subjects. We report a patient with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and delayed myelination caused by a novel SLC16A2 mutation (p.L291R). The thyroid hormones profile in our patient was atypical for Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. The follow-up examinations showed that the progression of the myelination was not accompanied by a clinical improvement.

8584127,"Neuroprotective effects of natural products: interaction with intracellular kinases, amyloid peptides and a possible role for transthyretin","Various studies reported on the neuroprotective effects of natural products, particularly polyphenols, widely present in food and beverages. For example, we have shown that resveratrol, a polyphenol contained present in red wine and other foods, activates the phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC), this effect being involved in its neuroprotective action against Ass-induced toxicity. Moreover, tea-derived catechin gallate esters inhibit the formation Ass oligomers/fibrils, suggesting that this action likely contributes to their neuroprotective effects. Interestingly, the effects of polyphenols may be attributable, at least in part, to the presence of specific binding sites. Autoradiographic studies revealed that these binding sites are particularly enriched in choroids plexus in the rat brain. Interestingly, the choroid plexus secretes transthyretin, a protein that has been shown to prevent Abeta aggregation and that may be critical to the maintenance of normal learning capacities in aging. Taken together, these data suggest that polyphenols target multiple enzymes/proteins leading to their neuroprotective actions.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584514,Cloning of putative piscine (Sparus aurata) transthyretin: developmental expression and tissue distribution,"cDNA encoding putative transthyretin (prealbumin, TTR) was cloned from liver of the marine fish Sparus aurata. The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 453 nt, encoding for a TTR precursor of 151 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of S. aurata TTR shows identity of 54, 57.3 and 54.1% with lizard, chicken and rat TTR, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed a TTR transcript of about 700 nt, highly expressed in liver, but also in skin. Low expression was detected in 12 other tissues by using RT-PCR. The ontogeny of TTR expression during early stages of larval development of S. aurata was examined by Northern blot analysis using poly(A+)RNA from larvae collected on different days after hatching. TTR mRNA was seen already on the first day after hatching and its steady-state levels increased from Day 15 onwards. Molecular cloning of a TTR-like cDNA from fish suggests that TTR evolved earlier in vertebrate development than previously thought. Furthermore, its expression in liver exceeds by several-fold that found in brain, yet high expression is also found in skin. These results suggest that in fish, liver is the main site of TTR synthesis, but that TTR may have an important function in fish skin.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Asymptomatic amyloid deposition in a variety of tissues is a universal accompaniment of ageing, and clinical amyloidosis is not rare. Intracerebral and cerebrovascular beta-protein amyloid deposits are a hallmark of the pathology of both sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease, beta 2-microglobulin-derived amyloid is a common complication of long term haemodialysis, and islet amyloid polypeptide is the fibril protein in the universal islet amyloidosis of type II diabetes mellitus. New fibril proteins have lately been identified in hereditary amyloidosis, including variants of gelsolin, apolipoprotein AI, lysozyme and fibrinogen. The development of radiolabelled serum amyloid P component (SAP) scintigraphy has allowed amyloid to be diagnosed non-invasively in vivo for the first time, provided unique insight into the distribution and size of amyloid deposits, and yielded novel information on the natural history and the effects of treatment. Amyloid deposits are in a state of dynamic turnover and can regress if new fibril formation is halted.

Six patients showed CNS symptoms associated with leptomeningeal amyloidosis. To examine the function of the blood-CSF barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB), the authors performed CSF and MRI studies. The authors also performed a histopathologic study of autopsy specimens to examine the distribution of amyloid deposition in the CNS.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>CSF study showed high total protein concentrations and increased albumin CSF/serum concentration quotients (Qalb; an indication of blood-CSF barrier function). MRI with gadolinium (Gd) revealed enhancement from brainstem to spinal cord. Serial brain MRI studies with FLAIR images after Gd administration showed Gd leakage into the subarachnoid space (two patients). These findings suggested the blood-CSF barrier and BBB dysfunctions. Constructive interference in steady state (CISS) three-dimensional Fourier transformation (CISS-3DFT) sequence analysis demonstrated amyloid-induced funiculus structures joining the spinal cord and dura mater (one patient). Histopathologic study revealed intense amyloid deposition in leptomeninges, vessel walls, and parenchyma in spinal cord and the brain. These distributions of amyloid deposition are unique compared to other TTR related leptomeningeal amyloidosis.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy amyloidogenic transthyretin Y114C had CNS disorders related to amyloid deposition in leptomeninges, vessel walls, and parenchyma in spinal cord and the brain.

Among the various modified prescriptions of YMJ, YMJ derivatives (YMJd) were formulated to enhance memory retention. This study has three goals: 1) to quantitatively evaluate the memory-enhancing effect of YMJd using behavior tasks; 2) to use cDNA micro-array tools to identify candidate genes responsible for enhancing memory; and 3) to statistically evaluate the specific gene expression patterns using Real-time PCR. Memory retention abilities are addressed by the passive avoidance task with SD male rat. The retention time of the YMJd group was significantly delayed (ca. 100%), whereas with Ginkgo biloba and Soya lecithin treatment, this was only delayed 20% and 10%, respectively. The cDNA from the hippocampi of YMJd and rat control groups were applied to an Incyte rat GEM2 cDNA microarray. The microarray results showed that transthyretin and PEP-19 were abundantly expressed in the YMJd treated group. Importantly, PEP-19 is a neuron-specific protein that inhibits apoptotic processes. On the other hand, neuronal genes involved in neuronal death or neurodegeneration, such as pentraxin and spectrin, were abundantly expressed in the control group.

This study replicated and extended to patients with nonrefractory depressive illness a pilot study indicating that patients with refractory major depression have significantly lower levels of CSF transthyretin than do healthy comparison subjects.<br /><br /><strong>METHOD: </strong>Lumbar punctures were performed in drug-free subjects with DSM-III-R major depression (N = 18), DSM-III-R bipolar disorder, depressed phase (N = 1), and healthy comparison subjects (N = 24). CSF concentrations of transthyretin, determined by a quantitative dot-immunobinding assay, of the depressed patients and comparison subjects were compared by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The relationship between CSF transthyretin levels and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores was determined in a subset of the depressed patients.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>CSF concentrations of transthyretin were significantly lower in the depressed patients than in the comparison subjects by ANCOVA. Within the depressed group there was no significant overall correlation between CSF transthyretin levels and Hamilton depression scale scores, but there was a significant inverse correlation in male depressed patients (N = 8) between CSF transthyretin concentrations and Hamilton depression scores.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Lower CSF transthyretin concentrations in depressed patients may reflect either a stable trait in this population or a state change secondary to depression or other factors. Lower CSF transthyretin concentrations may result in altered CNS thyroid hormone homeostasis.

8584372,The in vivo neuromodulatory effects of the herbal medicine ginkgo biloba,"Extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves are consumed as dietary supplements to counteract chronic, age-related neurological disorders. We have applied high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to define the transcriptional effects in the cortex and hippocampus of mice whose diets were supplemented with the herbal extract. Gene expression analysis focused on the mRNAs that showed a more than 3-fold change in their expression. In the cortex, mRNAs for neuronal tyrosine/threonine phosphatase 1, and microtubule-associated tau were significantly enhanced. Hyperphosphorylated tau is the major constituent of the neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. The expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-2, calcium and chloride channels, prolactin, and growth hormone (GH), all of which are associated with brain function, were also up-regulated. In the hippocampus, only transthyretin mRNA was upregulated. Transthyretin plays a role in hormone transport in the brain and possibly a neuroprotective role by amyloid-beta sequestration.

Thyroxine binding to transthyretin was detected in the blood of eutherians, diprotodont marsupials, and birds, but not in blood from fish, toads, reptiles, monotremes, and Australian polyprotodont marsupials. Globulins binding thyroxine were only observed in the plasma of some mammals. Apparently, albumin is the phylogenetically oldest thyroxine carrier in vertebrate blood. Transthyretin gene expression in the liver developed in parallel, and independently, in the evolutionary lineages leading to eutherians, to diprotodont marsupials, and to birds. In contrast, high transthyretin mRNA levels, strong synthesis, and secretion of transthyretin in choroid plexus from reptiles and birds indicate that transthyretin gene expression in the choroid plexus evolved much earlier than in the liver, probably at the stage of the stem reptiles.

We describe three cases of Hashimoto's encephalopathy and establish a relationship between the clinical status, the antithyroid antibody levels and its response to corticosteroid treatment. There was an excellent response to corticosteroid treatment in all three cases. Interestingly, one case was associated with Graves' disease. Given this, and after the review of the literature, we believe that the term 'encephalopathy associated to autoimmune thyroid disease' could be more appropriate to define this entity.

8584408,Colloid cyst of the third ventricle. A comparative immunohistochemical study of neuraxis cysts and choroid plexus epithelium,"In an effort to shed light upon the nature of the colloid cyst, the immunohistochemical properties of 21 examples of this lesion were compared with those of other neuraxial cysts and choroid plexus epithelium. The neuraxial cysts included the following: eight Rathke's cleft cysts, 25 pituitaries containing follicular cysts of the pars intermedia, and four enterogenous cysts. Fifteen examples of normal choroid plexus and 12 choroid plexus papillomas were studied as well. These lesions were examined for localization of the following antigens: cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, secretory component, carcinoembryonic antigen, prealbumin, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, 68-kD neurofilament protein, chromogranin, serotonin, and lysozyme, and with Leu-7 monoclonal antibodies. Five colloid cysts were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies that were specific for Clara-cell antigens and surfactant, respectively. Sugar moieties were localized using Ulex europaeus I, and Ricinus communis agglutinin I lectins. All Rathke's cleft cysts and follicular cysts of the pars intermedia as well as three selected colloid cysts were examined for pituitary hormones. The epithelial cells of colloid and enterogenous cysts, as well as those lining follicular and Rathke's cleft cyst, showed uniformly strong reactivity for cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, secretory component, and vimentin, and bound Ulex europaeus lectin. Occasional cells in colloid cysts were positive for Clara cell-specific antigens. Reaction for carcinoembryonic antigen was present on the apical surface of scattered cells of colloid, follicular, and Rathke's cleft cysts. Many cells of follicles in the pars intermedia as well as individual cells of five Rathke's cleft cysts were also immunoreactive for chromogranin, S-100 protein, GFAP, and pituitary hormones. Colloid and enterogenous cysts were negative for prealbumin, S-100 protein, GFAP, and neuron-specific enolase; in all but a few instances, they failed to bind Ricinus communis agglutinin. In contrast, normal choroid plexus and choroid plexus papillomas were positive for prealbumin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, cytokeratin, vimentin, and Ricinus communis agglutinin receptors; they lacked Ulex europaeus lectin, 56/66-kD cytokeratins, and epithelial membrane antigen. Unlike normal choroid plexus, choroid plexus papillomas were often GFAP-positive. All tissues studied were nonreactive for lysosome, serotonin, and neurofilament, and with Leu-7 antibodies. This study indicates that the immunophenotype of epithelium lining colloid cysts is similar to that of other cysts showing endodermal or ectodermal differentiation and to respiratory tract mucosa. Epithelium of colloid cysts is immunohistochemically different from that of normal or neoplastic choroid plexus. These findings indicate an endodermal rather than neuroepithelial nature for colloid cysts.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Transthyretin was found to be synthesized and secreted by choroid plexus from rats, echidnas, and lizards, but not toads. 2. Transthyretin was observed in blood from placental mammals, birds, and marsupials, but not reptiles and monotremes. 3. The obtained data suggest that transthyretin synthesis by the liver evolved independently in the lineage leading to the placental mammals and marsupials and in that leading to the birds. 4.

8623849,Molecular biology of brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders,"A significant component of the aging process is genetically determined. Numerous theories of aging exist, many of which postulate the existence of ''longevity genes.'' Recent advances in molecular biological and other techniques have allowed a significantly greater understanding df aging and age-related disease. This will be illustrated by four genetic and sporadic diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders, transthyretin dementia, cerebral amyloid angiopathy-Icelandic type and scrapie related diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common of this group, is the leading cause of dementia in Western countries. Recent genetic and biochemical studies have shown the involvement of at least four genes in the pathogenesis of AD. In early-onset familial AD mutations in the PPP, S182 (presenilin 1) and STM2 (presenilin 2 or E5-1) genes have been found, while in the more common late-onset AD the presence of the apolipoprotein E4 isotype is a major risk factor. Genetic studies have also helped to elucidate the etiology of rarer cerebral amyloidoses such as the recently described Hungarian amyloidosis that is characterized by meningocerebrovascular amyloid deposition, with resultant dementia. This disease is linked to a mutation in the transthyretin gene. It is hoped that in the near future this increase in knowledge will allow the development of therapeutic approaches to slow the aging process.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8623727,Dynamics of nutritional status in dying patients with acute cerebral infarction in central China: a preliminary study,"Background and aims: Stroke is the number one cause of death in China. Although the effective management has reduced the mortality and lengthened survival, little attention has been paid to nutritional issues in patients with stroke in China. This study aimed to assess the premorbid nutrition status in dying patients with acute cerebral infarction.Methods: In this study, a total of 185 acute ischemic stroke patients dying within 30 days were recruited from medical records. Characteristics of dying patients were assessed on admission, and serum biochemical parameters including serum total protein, serum albumin, and serum prealbumin were measured within 24 hours after stroke onset and every week routinely.Results: Among 185 ischemic stroke patients, 86 dying patients experienced their first-ever acute cerebral infarction, while 99 dying patients were experiencing a recurrent cerebral infarction. The prevalence of dysphagia, post-stroke pneumonia, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in recurrent stroke groups were higher than those in the first-ever stroke group (P<0.01). There were gradually declines in serum total protein, serum albumin, and serum prealbumin in dying patients from admission to death, especially in the recurrent ischemic stroke group, as compared to their normal range. The sensitive sequence of serum nutritional index for dying patients with ischemic infarction was: serum prealbumin. serum albumin. serum total protein.Conclusions: This study showed that hypoproteinemia and undernutrition were serious in dying patients with acute ischemic stroke, especially in patients with recurrent ischemic stroke. This study also confirmed that serum prealbumin is more sensitive than serum albumin to assess nutritional status.

In mammals, birds, and reptiles this protein is transthyretin, a tetramer of identical 15-kDa subunits. In this study choroid plexus from frogs, tadpoles, and toads incubated in vitro were found to synthesize and secrete one predominant protein. However, this consisted of one single 20-kDa polypeptide chain. It was expressed throughout amphibian metamorphosis. Part of its amino acid sequence was determined and used for construction of oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction. The amplified DNA was used to screen a toad choroid plexus cDNA library. Full-length cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced. The derived amino acid sequence for the encoded protein was 183 amino acids long, including a 20-amino acid presegment. The calculated molecular weight of the mature protein was 18,500. Sequence comparison with other proteins showed that the protein belonged to the lipocalin superfamily. Its expression was highest in choroid plexus, much lower in other brain areas, and absent from liver. Since no transthyretin was detected in proteins secreted from amphibian choroid plexus, abundant synthesis and secretion of transthyretin in choroid plexus must have evolved only after the stage of the amphibians.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The de novo conversion to infectious amyloids is facilitated or accelerated by many different point mutations causing amino acid changes, a stop codon, or octapeptide inserts that increase the likelihood of spontaneous conversion to infectious configuration by many orders of magnitude. Similar nucleating induction of configurational change to amyloid probably occurs in other amyloidoses of brain and in systemic amyloidoses. Thus, all amyloids, particularly so-called fibrillar amyloid enhancing factors, may be considered to be infectious scrapie-like agents. These events probably occur extracellularly, thus we are attempting to reproduce them in vitro, even from synthetic polypeptides.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584411,Transthyretin expression in medulloblastomas and medulloblastoma cell lines,"Transthyretin is a protein crucial to the transport of lipophilic molecules such as thyroid hormones and retinoids. In the central nervous system, large amounts of transthyretin are synthesized by the choroid plexus and are secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid. The choroid plexus is the only site of transthyretin synthesis in the brain. Transthyretin is expressed by most benign and malignant choroid plexus tumours while gliomas and meningiomas do not express transthyretin. Other major sites of transthyretin synthesis are the retinal pigment epithelium and hepatocytes. Medulloblastoma is the prototypical primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the cerebellum and can show multiple lines of differentiation, including the expression of retinal markers. In this study, we examined transthyretin expression both at the RNA and protein level in four medulloblastomas and six medulloblastoma cell lines using Northern and Western blot analysis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RNA in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. All four medulloblastomas and five of the six medulloblastoma cell lines expressed transthyretin-mRNA as demonstrated by reverse PCR and in situ hybridization while three medulloblastomas and one cell line were positive on Northern blot. The medulloblastoma with the most abundant RNA expression was transthyretin-immunoreactive on cryosections and the medulloblastoma cell line that was positive on Northern blot also expressed transthyretin at levels detectable by Western blot. No transthyretin-immunoreactivity was seen in 16 additional medulloblastomas studied on paraffin sections. These findings indicate that low-level expression of transthyretin-mRNA is common in medulloblastomas and medulloblastoma cell lines. Expression of transthyretin protein occurs rarely but can reach significant levels. Transthyretin expression in medulloblastoma is consistent with retinal pigment epithelium differentiation in medulloblastomas and reflects their pluripotential nature. Furthermore, the potential for transthyretin-immunoreactivity in medulloblastoma should be kept in mind when performing immunohistochemical studies on poorly differentiated cerebellar tumours.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Indications for a diminished V-CSF production, respectively, an increased transport of CSF-V-prealbumin into the spinal space were found in elderly patients suffering from diverse CNS diseases. As these alterations proved to be not disease-specific, the age-related increase of CSF transport was discussed with respect to brain atrophy and enlarged CSF spaces in the elderly central nervous system (CNS). CSF serum prealbumin content, an indicator of blood-brain-barrier function, increased with age similarly to albumin in the ""normal"" elderly, respectively with diverse CNS diseases.

8623858,Role of perivascular cells and myocytes in vascular amyloidosis,"Amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) by cells of the brain is the major pathologic component of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-beta (A beta) is of heterogeneous origin. Perivascular cells of monocyte-macrophage-microglial cell lineage produce fibrillar A beta in the wall of capillaries, whereas parenchymal microglial cells produce fibrillar A beta in the parenchyma of gray matter. Fibrillar A beta deposition by perivascular cells lead to endothelial cell degeneration and death, obliteration of affected capillaries, and reduction of the length of the vascular network. These changes cause local ischemia with neuronal degeneration and death. Smooth muscle cells are the source of A beta in the tunica media of parenchymal and leptomeningeal arteries and veins. Fibrillar A beta in the tunica media of leptomeningeal and parenchymal vessels causes degeneration and necrosis of smooth muscle cells and leads to multiple cortical hemorrhages. Smooth muscle cells isolated from blood vessels with amyloid deposits secrete A beta and accumulate nonfibrillar A beta intracellularly. The amyloidogenic processing of APP can be enhanced by apolipoprotein E, reduced by transthyretin, and modulated by several cytokines.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584506,Prolactin and autoimmunity,"The interrelationship between prolactin (PRL) and the immune system have been elucitaded in the last decade, opening new important horizons in the field of the immunoendocrinology. PRL is secreted not only by anterior pituitary gland but also by many extrapituitary sites including the immune cells. The endocrine/paracrine PRL has been shown to stimulate the immune cells by binding to PRL receptors. Increased PRL levels, frequently described in autoimmune diseases, could depend on the enhancement of coordinated bi-directional communications between PRL and the immune system observed in these diseases. Hyperprolactinemia has been described in the active phase of some non organ-specific autoimmune diseases, as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and organ-specific autoimmune diseases, as celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, autoimmune thyroid diseases. In these diseases PRL increases the syntesis of IFNgamma and IL-2 by Th1 lymphocytes. Moreover, PRL activates Th2 lymphocytes with autoantibody production. Of particular interest is the association between hyperprolactinemia and levels of anti DNA antibodies, islet cell antibodies (ICA), thyreoglobulin antibodies (TgAb), thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb), adrenocortical antibodies (ACA), transglutaminase antibodies (tTGAb) in SLE, in type 1 diabetes mellitus, in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, in Addison's disease and in celiac disease, respectively. High levels of PRL have been also frequently detected in patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis (LYH). Several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the hyperprolactinemia in LYH. The PRL increase could be secondary to the inflammatory process of the pituitary gland but, on the other hand, this increase could have a role in enhancing the activity of the immune process in LYH. Moreover, the detection of antipituitary antibodies targeting PRL-secreting cells in some patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia suggests the occurrence of a possible silent LYH in these patients. Finally, the role of anti-prolactinemic drugs to inactivate the immune process in LYH is still discussed.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

There are now approximately 26 point mutations in the transthyretin gene associated with FAP. Because of the overlapping clinical phenotypes described with these mutations, it is now more appropriate to classify the various forms of FAP according to the underlying genetic defect rather than on clinical grounds. Many questions concerning the amyloidogenic nature of transthyretin and the variability of organ involvement depending on the underlying mutation remain unanswered.

This is followed by a description of the histology of the choroid plexuses (CP) and discussion on the functions of the choroid plexus and on the composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The methods of measuring the rate of secretion of CSF will be outlined and the possible nutritive functions of the choroid plexuses will be considered. The role of the choroid plexuses in the control of the concentration of glucose and amino acids in CSF will be compared with data from in vitro experiments to that from the isolated vascularly perfused choroid plexuses. The handling of peptides and proteins by the CP and the synthesis of these molecules by this tissue is then discussed and the effects of lead on the synthesis of transthyretin by this tissue.

8584471,"Comparison of amyloid deposition in two lines of transgenic mouse that model familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, type I","We previously produced a transgenic mouse line designated MT-hMet30 by introducing the human mutant transthyretin (TTR) gene carrying the mouse metallothionein promoter, and showed that the presence of human variant TTR is sufficient for amyloid deposition in various tissues of these transgenic mice. However, the expression pattern of human mutant transthyretin gene in the mouse was different from that in man. To analyse pathologic processes, it is essential to establish a transgenic mouse line in which the development and tissue-specific expression of the human mutant TTR gene is the same as in man. Thus, we produced two additional transgenic mouse lines carrying the human mutant TTR gene containing either 0.6 kb (0.6-hMet30) or 6.0 kb (6.0- hMet30) of the upstream region. The expression levels of 6.0-hMet 30 gene in the liver and serum were the same as in man and about 10 times higher than those of 0.6-hMet30 gene in the liver and serum were the same as similar tissues to human patients except for the peripheral and autonomic nervous tissues. The amyloid deposition started earlier and was more extensive in 6.0-hMet30 than 0.6-hMet30 mice, suggesting that the serum levels of human mutant TTR are correlated with the occurrence and degree of amyloid deposition, to some extent. Neither amyloid deposition nor degenerative changes were observed in the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems despite the transgene expression in the choroid plexus of the 6.0-hMet30 mice. In the 6.0-hMet30 mice, amyloid deposition started at 9 months of age, although the serum level of human mutant TTR reached the adult level at 1 month. These results suggest that intrinsic environmental factors other than the mutant gene are involved in the late-onset deposition of amyloid fibrils.

The pulmonary parenchyma was also diffusely involved, but renal glomeruli, follicular tissues of the thyroid, and the leptomeninges and subarachnoidal vessels of the central nervous system showed little deposition.

Normal brain tissues from all sites studied contained CC mRNA. Immunoreactive CC was present in the choroid plexus epithelial cells, cerebral and cerebellar neurons, astrocytes, ependymal cells, macrophage-like cells of the arachnoid membrane and in neuroendocrine cells of the anterior pituitary lobe. TTR mRNA and TTR were restricted to the choroid plexus. In primary brain tumors, the transcript for CC was found in all 39 tumors examined, while the protein could only be demonstrated in 3/5 choroid plexus papillomas, 8/8 astrocytomas, 7/23 anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, 1/6 oligodendrogliomas, 1/1 oligoastrocytoma, 1/4 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, 3/7 ependymomas, 0/1 anaplastic ependymoma, 0/5 primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 0/1 neuroblastoma, 3/11 meningiomas and 16/16 pituitary adenomas. CC cannot be used as a marker for any specific brain tumor type but the fact that the protein could be demonstrated more frequently in astrocytomas than in their more malignant counterparts suggests that the cellular production and secretion of CC changes with the malignant progression of these tumors.

The South American opossum was chosen because the young are born around the time of choroid plexus formation. Previous work showed that in the adult opossum, transthyretin is expressed in the choroid plexus cells. However, systematic studies of transthyretin in the choroid plexus during development have not been carried out before. Transthyretin was present in 90-95% of the choroidal cells form birth to adulthood. In most cells, transthyretin immunoreactivity was concentrated in the apical region of the cytoplasm. Double labelling of choroid plexus sections with antibodies to albumin and transthyretin showed that 1-2% of cells were positive for both proteins. These findings suggest that from the very earliest stage of choroid plexus formation most epithelial cells both synthesize and contain transthyretin, and a few of these transthyretin-synthesizing cells also contain albumin that is probably being transferred form blood to the cerebrospinal fluid.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

We previously reported that exposing transgenic mice harboring APPswe/PS1deltaE9 transgenes to an enriched environment resulted in reduced levels of Abeta peptides and deposition, findings that were correlated with an increase in the expression of TTR, encoding transthyretin (TTR). TTR is expressed at high levels in the choroid plexus and known to bind Abeta peptides and modulate their aggregation in vitro and in vivo. To explore the impact of TTR expression on Abeta levels and deposition in vivo, we crossed ceAPPswe/PS1deltaE9 transgenic mice to mice with genetic ablations of TTR. We now report that the levels of detergent-soluble and formic acid-soluble levels of Abeta and deposition are elevated in the brains of ceAPPswe/PS1deltaE9/TTR+/- mice compared with age-matched ceAPPswe/PS1deltaE9/TTR+/+ mice.

8584343,"Human subcommissural organ, with particular emphasis on its secretory activity during the fetal life","The subcommissural organ (SCO) is a conserved brain gland present throughout the vertebrate phylum. During ontogeny, it is the first secretory structure of the brain to differentiate. In the human, the SCO can be morphologically distinguished in 7- to 8-week-old embryos. The SCO of 3- to 5-month-old fetuses is an active, secretory structure of the brain. However, already in 9-month-old fetuses, the regressive development of the SCO-parenchyma is evident. In 1-year-old infants, the height of the secretory ependymal cells is distinctly reduced and they are grouped in the form of islets that alternate with cuboid non-secretory ependyma. The regression of the SCO continues during childhood, so that at the ninth year of life the specific secretory parenchyma is confined to a few islets of secretory ependymal cells. The human fetal SCO shares the distinct ultrastructural features characterizing the SCO of all other species, namely, a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, with many of its cisternae being dilated and filled with a filamentous material, several Golgi complexes, and secretory granules of variable size, shape, and electron density. The human fetal SCO does not immunoreact with any of the numerous polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against RF-glycoproteins of animal origin. This and the absence of RF in the human led to the conclusion that the human SCO does not secrete RF-glycoproteins. Taking into account the ultrastructural, lectin-histochemical, and immunocytochemical findings, it can be concluded that the human SCO, and most likely the SCO of the anthropoid apes, secrete glyco- protein(s) with a protein backbone of unknown nature, and with a carbohydrate chain similar or identical to that of RF-glycoproteins secreted by the SCO of all other species. These, as yet unidentified, glycoprotein(s) do not aggregate but become soluble in the CSF. Evidence is presented that these CSF-soluble proteins secreted by the human SCO correspond to (1) a 45-kDa compound similar or identical to transthyretin and, (2) a protein of about 500 kDa.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Case report,"Isolated amyloidomas may, albeit rarely, involve the central nervous system. There are three previous reports of amyloidomas that involved the gasserian ganglion and caused unilateral trigeminal neuropathies. The authors report the case of a 49-year-old woman with apparently isolated amyloidomas that caused slowly progressive bilateral trigeminal neuropathies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed mild swelling of the left trigeminal nerve within the cavernous sinus and uniform enhancement with gadolinium throughout the length of the nerve. At craniotomy, the trigeminal nerve and ganglion were observed to be infiltrated by a tumor-like mass. Biopsy showed extensive infiltration of the nerve and ganglion by amyloid. Immunocytochemical studies of the amyloid were negative for immunoglobulins, kappa and lambda light chains, beta-amyloid A4 protein, transthyretin, beta 2-microglobulin, cystatin C, and gelsolin, but weak focal immunoreactivity with antiamyloid AA antibody was seen in the amyloid in vessels and in some intraneural deposits.

8584145,[Case report of a patient with Hashimoto's encephalopathy associated with Basedow's disease mimicking Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease],"A 79-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of unconsciousness and convulsion following mental deterioration. On admission, she exhibited myoclonic movement of the right side of the face and right fingers in addition to rigospasticity and tremors in the right arm and leg. Laboratory tests revealed hyperthyroidism with an increased anti-TSH-R antibody titer. In addition, an echogram indicated excessive blood flow at the thyroid; hence, the patient was diagnosed with Basedow's disease. Interestingly, the tests also revealed increased titer of anti-TPO antibody, anti-Tg antibody, and anti-NH2 terminal of alpha-enolase (NAE) antibody; in addition, an EEG showed abnormal findings potentially indicating periodic synchronous discharge. Brain MRI showed cerebral atrophy, and brain 99mTc-ECD-SPECT images demonstrated an overall decrease in the accumulation of 99mTc in the cerebrum. The abovementioned findings are common to patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). We initiated treatment for hyperthyroidism with thiamazole and lugol, but this did not regain consciousness. Because she had anti-thyroid antibody was observed, we considered a differential diagnosis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy and, in fact, methylprednisolone pulse therapy alleviated her symptoms and normalized the EEG findings. The condition in this case clinically mimicked CJD; therefore, the differentiated diagnosis is important because Hashimoto's encephalopathy is treatable disease.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584148,Development of affinity columns for the removal of high-abundance proteins in cerebrospinal fluid,"Various approaches for removal of high-abundance components in body fluids are currently available. While most methods are constructed for plasma depletion, there is a need for body-fluid-specific strategies. The aim of the present study was to design an affinity matrix suitable for the depletion of high-abundance proteins in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). Hence, molecules with specific affinity towards proteins present at high concentration in CSF were desired. Affibody molecules are specific binders of small size that have shown high stability under various conditions and are therefore good candidates for such a matrix. The protein composition in CSF resembles that in plasma. However, 20% of the proteins are brain-derived and are therefore present in higher proportions in CSF than in plasma, whereas larger plasma-derived proteins are less abundant in CSF. Therefore five high-abundance CSF proteins were chosen for the design of a CSF-specific depletion setup. Affibody molecules with specificity towards HSA (human serum albumin), IgG, transferrin and transthyretin were combined in an affinity column. In addition, polyclonal antibodies against cystatin C were coupled to chromatographic beads and packed in a separate column. Highly reproducible and efficient removal of the five target proteins was observed. The proportion of depleted proteins were estimated to be 99, 95, 74, 92 and 83% for HSA, IgG, transferrin, transthyretin and cystatin C respectively. SDS/PAGE analysis was used for monitoring and identifying proteins in native CSF, depleted CSF samples and the captured fractions. Moreover, shotgun proteomics was used for protein identification in native as well as depleted CSF and the achieved data were compared. Enhanced identification of lower-abundance components was observed in the depleted fraction, in terms of more detected peptides per protein.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584149,Correlation of L-methyl-11C-methionine (MET) uptake with L-type amino acid transporter 1 in human gliomas,"L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is a neutral amino acid transport system and is a major route for the transport of large neutral amino acids, including methionine, through the plasma membrane. LAT1 requires the heavy chain of 4F2 cell surface antigen (4F2hc) for its functional expression. Positron emission tomography (PET) with L-[methyl-(11)C] methionine (MET) provides information about amino acid metabolism in brain tumors. We conducted a clinicopathologic study to elucidate the correlation of LAT1 and 4F2hc expression with MET uptake in patients with newly diagnosed human gliomas. Thirty-three newly diagnosed glioma patients were enrolled in this study. Uptake of MET in the tumor was evaluated with the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Expression of the LAT1, 4F2hc, and CD34, and Ki-67 labeling index of the tumor were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, and the correlation with the SUVmax in the tumors was examined. Expression of LAT1 and 4F2hc was higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas. The grade of LAT1 immunostaining increased with glioma grade. LAT1 was mainly expressed in the tumor cytoplasm and vascular endothelium and 4F2hc was mainly expressed in the tumor cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Expression of LAT1 but not 4F2hc was significantly correlated with MET SUVmax. Expression of LAT1 in the tumor vascular endothelium is significantly correlated with CD34 positive microvessel density. In conclusion, MET SUVmax correlates with LAT1 expression in the tumor in newly diagnosed gliomas. MET transport may be increased by an increased number of microvessels combined with a higher density or activity of LAT1 in the tumor endothelial cells in high-grade gliomas. Use of MET-PET as a molecular target combined with anti-angiogenesis in glioma therapy should be addressed in future studies.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584150,Transthyretin enhances nerve regeneration,"Mutations in transthyretin (TTR) are associated with familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by TTR deposition in the PNS. The aim of this study was to unravel whether TTR has a role in nerve physiology that could account for its preferential accumulation in the PNS, when mutated. The sensorimotor performance of wild-type and TTR knockout (KO) littermate mice was compared and showed impairment in mice lacking TTR. Given the possibility that, upon regeneration, the consequences arising from TTR absence might be exacerbated, nerve crush was performed in both strains. TTR KO mice presented delayed functional recovery resulting from decreased number of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. Moreover, in transgenic mice in a TTR KO background, expressing human TTR in neurons, this phenotype was rescued, reinforcing that TTR enhances nerve regeneration. In vitro assays showed that neurite outgrowth and extension were decreased in the absence of TTR, probably underlying the decreased number of regenerating axons in TTR KO mice. Our findings demonstrate that TTR participates in nerve physiology and that it enhances nerve regeneration. Moreover, the assignment of a TTR function in nerve biology and repair, may explain its preferential deposition, when mutated, in the PNS of familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584152,Pharmacokinetic role of L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT2,"LAT1 and LAT2 are heterodimeric large amino acid transporters that are expressed in various tissues, including the intestinal wall, blood-brain barrier, and kidney. These transporters consist of membrane spanning light chain and heavy chain, and they act as 1:1 exchangers in concert with other amino acid transporters. Only a few drugs (less than 10) are substrates of LAT1 and LAT2, including L-DOPA, alpha-methyldopa, melphalan, and gabapentin. The mechanisms and substrates have been mostly elucidated using mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes. The in vivo relevance of LAT1 and LAT2 in pharmacokinetics is obscure, because contradictory findings have been reported. It is difficult to make quantitative pharmacokinetic conclusions about LAT1 and LAT2. This is due to the possible involvement of other transporters (including cross-linked heterodimers of light chain with different heavy chains, other overlapping transporters, for example TAT1), competing endogenous amino acids, and saturation phenomena. This review presents the current functional knowledge on LAT1 and LAT2 with emphasis on their potential involvement in pharmacokinetics.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
8584153,Derivation of primary choroid plexus epithelial cells from the mouse,"Choroid plexus epithelial cells form an integral and important part of the barrier between blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Culture of choroid plexus epithelium in vitro has been achieved from several mammalian species and this provides opportunities for the study of choroid plexus development and function, including the capacity of the epithelial cells to control the movement of bioactive molecules, such as novel drug candidates, from the bloodstream to the brain. Here we describe a method for the derivation of primary cell cultures from mouse choroid plexus epithelium, together with characterisation by immunofluorescence using antibodies specific to markers of mature choroid plexus epithelial cells. With this method, relatively pure choroid plexus epithelial cell monolayers are established using the DNA synthesis inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), which is cytotoxic to contaminating cell types such as fibroblasts, but not the epithelial cells. These cells are shown to express the diagnostic choroidal marker, transthyretin (TTR), as well as markers of epithelial cell differentiation and are thus suitable for studies that address the transport and barrier functions of the choroid plexus.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8583617,Amyloid-clearing proteins and their epigenetic regulation as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease,"Abnormal elevation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) levels in the brain is the primary trigger for neuronal cell death specific to Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is now evident that Aβ levels in the brain are manipulable due to a dynamic equilibrium between its production from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and removal by amyloid clearance proteins. Clearance can be either enzymic or non-enzymic (binding/transport proteins). Intriguingly several of the main amyloid-degrading enzymes (ADEs) are members of the M13 peptidase family (neprilysin (NEP), NEP2 and the endothelin converting enzymes (ECE-1 and -2)). A distinct metallopeptidase, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), also contributes to Aβ degradation in the brain. The ADE family currently embraces more than 20 members, both membrane-bound and soluble, and of differing cellular locations. NEP plays an important role in brain function terminating neuropeptide signals. Its decrease in specific brain areas with age or after hypoxia, ischaemia or stroke contribute significantly to the development of AD pathology. The recently discovered mechanism of epigenetic regulation of NEP (and other genes) by the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and its dependence on the cell type and APP isoform expression suggest possibilities for selective manipulation of NEP gene expression in neuronal cells. We have also observed that another amyloid-clearing protein, namely transthyretin (TTR), is also regulated in the neuronal cell by a mechanism similar to NEP. Dependence of amyloid clearance proteins on histone deacetylases and the ability of HDAC inhibitors to up-regulate their expression in the brain opens new avenues for developing preventive strategies in AD.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8584183,Classical maple syrup urine disease and brain development: Principles of management and formula design,"Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584184,"Matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors in cardiac amyloidosis: relationship to structural, functional myocardial changes and to light chain amyloid deposition","<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Cardiac amyloidosis is characterized by amyloid infiltration resulting in extracellular matrix disruption. Amyloid cardiomyopathy due to immunoglobulin light chain protein (AL-CMP) deposition has an accelerated clinical course and a worse prognosis compared with non-light chain cardiac amyloidoses (ie, forms associated with wild-type or mutated transthyretin [TTR]). We therefore tested the hypothesis that determinants of proteolytic activity of the extracellular matrix, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) would have distinct patterns and contribute to the pathogenesis of AL-CMP versus TTR-related amyloidosis.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>We studied 40 patients with systemic amyloidosis: 10 AL-CMP patients, 20 patients with TTR-associated forms of cardiac amyloidosis, ie, senile systemic amyloidosis (involving wild-type TTR) or mutant TTR, and 10 patients with AL amyloidosis without cardiac involvement. Serum MMP-2 and -9, TIMP-1, -2, and -4, brain natriuretic peptide values, and echocardiography were determined. AL-CMP and TTR-related amyloidosis groups had similar degrees of increased left ventricular wall thickness. However, brain natriuretic peptide, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 levels were distinctly elevated accompanied by marked diastolic dysfunction in the AL-CMP group versus no or minimal increases in the TTR-related amyloidosis group. Brain natriuretic peptide, MMPs, and TIMPs were not correlated with the degree of left ventricular wall thickness but were correlated to each other and to measures of diastolic dysfunction. Immunostaining of human endomyocardial biopsies showed diffuse expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in AL-CMP and limited expression in TTR-related amyloidosis hearts.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Despite comparable left ventricular wall thickness with TTR-related cardiac amyloidosis, AL-CMP patients have higher brain natriuretic peptide, MMPs, and TIMPs, which correlated with diastolic dysfunction. These findings suggest a relationship between light chains and extracellular matrix proteolytic activation that may play an important role in the functional and clinical manifestations of AL-CMP, distinct from the other non-light chain cardiac amyloidoses.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

A follow-up CSF sample was obtained approximately 15 days after admission. TP concentration was determined in the CSF and 7.5% polycrylamide gel electrophoresis was employed for serum and CSF protein fractioning. A low percentage of prealbumin fraction was considered a test of impaired B-CSFB.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Elevated TP concentration and lower prealbumin were observed in almost 70% of the patients on admission, but this percentage was lower (52.4%) during the first week from onset of symptoms. Both variables were directly associated with the time of evolution of the disease and also with a greater clinical severity. Follow-up CSF studies showed higher CSF TP and lower prealbumin percentages, while deceased patients did not display this response pattern in the follow-up CSF.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>B-CSFB dysfunction was present in only half of the patients with GBS during the first week from onset and it was directly associated with progression and clinical severity; nevertheless, a low B-CSFB dysfunction response during follow-up was associated with a lethal outcome, suggesting it could also serve a 'protective' effect during regeneration.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584186,Deletion of Irs2 reduces amyloid deposition and rescues behavioural deficits in APP transgenic mice,"As impaired insulin signalling (IIS) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease we crossed mice (Tg2576) over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP), with insulin receptor substrate 2 null (Irs2(-/-)) mice which develop insulin resistance. The resulting Tg2576/Irs2(-/-) animals had increased tau phosphorylation but a paradoxical amelioration of Abeta pathology. An increase of the Abeta binding protein transthyretin suggests that increased clearance of Abeta underlies the reduction in plaques. Increased tau phosphorylation correlated with reduced tau-phosphatase PP2A, despite an inhibition of the tau-kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3. Our findings demonstrate that disruption of IIS in Tg2576 mice has divergent effects on pathological processes-a reduction in aggregated Abeta but an increase in tau phosphorylation. However, as these effects are accompanied by improvement in behavioural deficits, our findings suggest a novel protective effect of disrupting IRS2 signalling in AD which may be a useful therapeutic strategy for this condition.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8622320,Neuronal production of transthyretin in human and murine Alzheimer's disease: is it protective?,"Transthyretin (TTR), a systemic amyloid precursor in the human TTR amyloidoses, interacts with β-amyloid (Aβ) in vitro, inhibits Aβ fibril formation, and suppresses the Alzheimer's disease (AD) phenotype in APP23 mice bearing a human APP gene containing the Swedish autosomal dominant AD mutation. In the present study, we show that TTR is a neuronal product upregulated in AD. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that, in contrast to brains from non-demented age-matched individuals and control mice, the majority of hippocampal neurons from human AD and all those from the APP23 mouse brains contain TTR. Quantitative PCR for TTR mRNA and Western blot analysis show that primary neurons from APP23 mice transcribe TTR mRNA, and the cells synthesize and secrete TTR protein. TTR mRNA abundance is greatly increased in cultured cortical and hippocampal embryonic neurons and cortical lysates from adult APP23 mice. Antibodies specific for TTR and Aβ pulled down TTR/Aβ complexes from cerebral cortical extracts of APP23 mice and some human AD patients but not from control brains. In complementary tissue culture experiments, recombinant human TTR suppressed the cytotoxicity of soluble Aβ aggregates added to mouse neurons and differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The findings that production of Aβ, its precursor, or its related peptides induces neuronal TTR transcription and synthesis and the presence of Aβ/TTR complexes in vivo suggest that increased TTR production coupled with interaction between TTR and Aβ and/or its related peptides may play a role in natural resistance to human AD.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

TTR amyloidosis is linked to a vast number of mutations with varying phenotype, tissue distribution and age of onset. The most prevalent mutation associated with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is the V30M mutation. Studies of transgenic mouse models of TTR V30M FAP have been hampered by variable phenotype, low disease penetrance, and slow onset.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS/RESULTS: </strong>To model TTR-associated amyloid disease in the Drosophila model system, transgenic Drosophila were generated, expressing wild-type (wt) TTR or TTR V30M, associated with sporadic senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) and inherited FAP, respectively. We found that expression of FAP-associated TTR V30M mutant in the nervous system resulted in reduced lifespan and in reduced climbing ability indicating neurological impairment, whereas expression of TTR wt showed a milder phenotype. Congo red staining of the Drosophila brain shows positive amyloid binding in the aged TTR V30M flies. Extensive brain vacuole formation was evident for the aged TTR V30M flies, whereas a milder phenotype was shown by the TTR wt flies. In addition, expression of TTR V30M in the eye leads to tissue damage, including rough eye, morphological changes and fibrous deposition.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Our results suggest that Drosophila is a promising complementary system for studies of TTR-associated amyloid diseases.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
8584188,Association of TTR polymorphisms with hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer disease families,"In vitro and animal model studies suggest that transthyretin (TTR) inhibits the production of the amyloid β protein, a major contributor to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. We evaluated the association of 16 TTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with AD risk in 158 African American and 469 Caucasian discordant sibships from the MIRAGE Study. There was no evidence for association of TTR with AD in either population sample. To examine the possibility that TTR SNPs affect specific components of the AD process, we tested association of these SNPs with four measures of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of 48 African American and 265 Caucasian sibships. Five of seven common SNPs and several haplotypes were significantly associated with hippocampal atrophy in the Caucasian sample. Two of these SNPs also showed marginal evidence for association in the African American sample. Results for the other MRI traits were unremarkable.

8584196,Asymmetric expression patterns of brain transthyretin in normal mice and a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"Brain asymmetry is linked with several neurological diseases, and transthyretin (TTR) is a protein sequestering beta-amyloid (Abeta) and helping to prevent the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We show, by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in situ hybridization and Western blotting, that TTR exhibits a pattern of adult male-specific, leftward distribution in the mouse brain. This asymmetry appeared to be mainly due to the asymmetric distribution of the choroid plexus cells in the ventricles. Unlike the normal mice, however, the hemispheric levels of TTR transcripts of 2- and 6-month-old Tg2576 mice, a transgenic AD mouse model overexpressing Abeta, were symmetric in both sexes. Furthermore, at the age of 10 months when the pathological AD-like features had developed, the level of TTR transcripts in the left hemisphere of the male Tg2576 became significantly lower than the right one. This lowering of TTR transcript is accompanied with a higher Abeta level in the left hemisphere of the 10-month Tg2576 males. Finally, for both genders, the TTR transcript levels in the two hemispheres of aged Tg2576 mice were lower than either the adult Tg2576 or the aged nontransgenic controls. Based on the above, we suggest scenarios to correlate the changes in the levels and hemispheric patterns of TTR expression to the pathogenesis of AD.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

It reached a peak at 48 hours after injury, and thereafter decreased. 4F2hc was abundant and unchanged all through the time course after SCI. Western blot analysis under reductive and non-reductive conditions showed that LAT1 and 4F2hc were conjugated as a heterodimeric transporter and the functional regulation was dependent on the light chain, LAT1.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>We suggest that LAT1 may be transiently upregulated as part of the tissue-repair process after traumatic contusion injury in the spinal cord.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Measurement of Troponin T, troponin I and BNP.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Troponin T was detectable in only three patients who all had abnormal interventricular septal (IVS) thickness. Troponin I was abnormal in six patients (21%), of which only two had an increased IVS thickness. The heart function was generally well preserved in the patients in spite of hypertrophy of the IVS in 14 patients.

We assessed poststroke complications and 3-month outcome using modified Rankin Scale responder analysis.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Of 131 patients included in this study, undernutrition was observed in 16 (12.2%) patients at admission and in 26 (19.8%) at 1 week. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that baseline undernutrition independently predicted 1-week undernutrition (odds ratio [OR], 14.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.52-62.76; P< .001) and poststroke complications (OR, 6.72; 95% CI, 1.09-41.56; P= .04), and that 1-week undernutrition (OR, 4.49; 95% CI, 1.07-18.94; P= .04) and 1-week National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.31-2.37; P< .001) independently predicted poor 3-month outcomes.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>These findings suggest that acute ischemic stroke patients with baseline undernutrition are being undernourished during hospitalization.

Spatiotemporal localization of Ttr mRNA during embryogenesis suggested that Ttr regulatory elements might drive transgene expression throughout the visceral endoderm of early mouse embryos. We use Ttr cis-regulatory elements to generate Ttr::RFP and Ttr::Cre strains of mice, driving red fluorescent protein (RFP) and a nuclear-localized Cre recombinase, respectively. Visualization of RFP fluorescence in Ttr::RFP transgenics confirms reporter localization throughout the visceral endoderm in early embryos and in the visceral yolk sac and fetal liver of later stage embryos. Using both GFP-based and LacZ-based Cre reporter strains, we demonstrate that in Ttr::Cre transgenics, Cre-mediated recombination occurs throughout the visceral endoderm. The Ttr::Cre strain can therefore be used as a tool for genetic modifications within the visceral endoderm lineage.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Patients with a diagnosis of depression have reduced CSF levels of TTR and the locus encoding the TTR gene has been implicated in a Danish pedigree of bipolar patients. Lithium, the major treatment for bipolar disorder in the UK, was subcutaneously infused into rats for 28 days in the form of lithium chloride using osmotic minipumps. In situ hybridizations using oligonucleotide probes targeted against the TTR transcript were performed on coronal brain sections. Lithium significantly reduced the level of transthyretin mRNA in the rat choroid plexus within the lateral and third ventricle. The down-regulation was confirmed using semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR on dissected brain tissue. Recent studies in mice suggest that the TTR gene is implicated in depression-like behavior therefore this effect of lithium may be relevant to its use as a mood stabilizer or an adjuvant to antidepressant drugs.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Choroid plexus (CP) cells secrete neurotrophic factors, and CP transplants are neuroprotective in rat models of HD. To determine if similar neuroprotective effects could be obtained in primates, porcine CP was encapsulated in alginate capsules. PCR confirmed that the CP cells expressed transthyretin and immunocytochemistry demonstrated typical ZO-1 and tubulin staining. In vitro, CP conditioned media enhanced the survival and preserved neurite number and length on serum deprived neurons. Cynomolgus primates were transplanted with CP-loaded capsules into the caudate and putamen followed by quinolinic acid (QA) lesions 1 week later. Control monkeys received empty capsules plus QA. Choroid plexus transplants significantly protected striatal neurons as revealed by stereological counts of NeuN-positive neurons (8% loss vs. 43% in controls) and striatum volume (10% decrease vs. 40% in controls).

8584306,ProApolipoprotein A1: a serum marker of brain metastases in lung cancer patients,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Central nervous system (CNS) diagnostics is a promising tool for detection of neurological disorders, including brain metastases. One of the earliest applications of CNS diagnostics was based on serum markers of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, which often correlates with acute, chronic, or incipient brain disease. In the case of brain metastases, serum levels of S100beta demonstrated a good negative predictive value comparable to radiologic investigations. However, a confounding factor was the presence of BBB changes due to cerebrovascular disease.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Of 103 patients enrolled in a lung cancer study, greater than 50% presented with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes consistent with chronic cerebrovascular disease and reflected by elevated serum S100beta. To unveil serum protein, the authors used proteomic techniques that allow discrimination between patients with brain metastases and lung cancer patients affected by cerebrovascular ischemic changes without infiltrating tumor.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>ProApolipoprotein A1, transferrin, haptoglobin, and transthyretin were upregulated in patients affected by chronic cerebrovascular disease and brain metastases compared with those affected only by vascular diseases. ProApolipoprotein A1 was significantly increased (p<.05) in patients with CNS disease.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>In conclusion, these data support the use of serum markers for the early detection of brain metastases.

However, the current 'gold standard' of diagnosis, namely microscopic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is false-negative in 25% of patients at the first lumbar puncture. In a previous study, we analyzed a set of 151 CSF samples (tryptic digests) by MALDI-TOF and detected peptide masses that were differentially expressed in breast cancer patients with LM. In the present study, we obtain for a limited number of samples exact masses for these peptides by MALDI-FTICR MS measurements. Identification of these peptides was performed by electrospray FTICR MS after separation by nano-scale LC. The database results were confirmed by targeted high mass accuracy measurements of the fragment ions in the FTICR cell. The combination of automated high-throughput MALDI-TOF measurements and analysis by FTICR MS leads to the identification of 17 peptides corresponding to 9 proteins. These include proteins that are operative in host-disease interaction, inflammation and immune defense (serotransferrin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, hemopexin, haptoglobin and transthyretin).

Overt amyloid vasculopathy characterized by lesions of the vascular wall with a media totally replaced by amyloid substance may be observed.<br /><br /><strong>CLINICAL EXPRESSION: </strong>Lobular hemorrhage, often with recurrent episodes is the most frequent manifestation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cerebral infarcts or leukoencephalopathy may also be observed. An association with cerebral angiitis has been reported in a few cases. SPORADIC OR FAMILIAL DISEASE: Several types can be distinguished depending on the sporadic or familiar nature of the disease pattern as well as the chemical make-up of the protein deposit. In sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy the deposit is composed of protein A beta, and in familial cases, of protein A beta, cystatin C, gelsosine or transthyretin.

Liver transplantation (LT), which removes the main source of mTTR, does not prevent deterioration of the clinical condition in all recipients.<br /><br /><strong>MATERIAL AND METHODS: </strong>We evaluated the distribution of AD in the central and peripheral nervous system in order to better understand the pathophysiology of FAP and the potential role of lesions of nerve blood vessels and of mTTR released by choroid plexuses (CP). Forty nerve biopsy specimens and 3 autopsy cases, including 7 patients who underwent liver transplantation, all from patients with symptomatic FAP and DNA mutation of the TTR gene, were included.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Patients were ranged into three categories: MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES: Amyloid predominated around endoneurial capillaries in 37 patients, with occlusion/destruction of endoneurial capillaries in 15 nerves at late stages of the disease. Post-mortem examination showed amyloid in choroid plexuses and perivascular spaces in the brain and around blood vessels penetrating the endoneurium, following arachnoid and connective tissue septae. Destruction of endoneurial blood vessels is a late event in the natural course of FAP. Morphological findings were similar in patients who underwent liver transplantation and in those who did not. The distribution of amyloid in areas communicating with the subarachnoid space suggests that mutated TTR released in the CSF may move to the endoneurial fluid and accumulate in peripheral nerves, accounting for lack of efficacy of liver transplantation in some individuals.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584336,Choroid plexus: target for polypeptides and site of their synthesis,"Choroid plexus (CP) is an important target organ for polypeptides. The fenestrated phenotype of choroidal endothelium facilitates the penetration of blood-borne polypeptides across the capillary walls. Thus, both circulating and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-borne polypeptides can reach their receptors on choroidal epithelium. Several polypeptides have been demonstrated to regulate CSF formation by controlling blood flow to choroid plexus and/or the activity of ion transport in choroidal epithelium. However, many ligand-receptor interactions occurring in the CP are not involved in the regulation of fluid secretion. Increasing evidence suggests that the choroidal epithelium plays an important role in hormonal signaling via a receptor-mediated transport into the brain (e.g., leptin) and helps to clear certain CSF-borne polypeptides (e.g., soluble amyloid beta-protein). Thus, impaired choroidal transport or insufficient clearance of polypeptides may contribute to pathogenesis of systemic or central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as obesity or Alzheimer's disease. CP epithelium is not only a target but is also a source of neuropeptides, growth factors, and cytokines in the CNS. These polypeptides following their release into the CSF may exert distal, endocrine-like effects on target cells in the brain due to bulk flow of this fluid. Distinct temporal patterns of choroidal expression of several polypeptides are observed during brain development and in various CNS disorders, including traumatic brain injury and ischemia. Therefore, it is proposed that the CP plays an integral role not only in normal brain functioning, but also in the recovery from the injury.

Based on its amino acid identity of 88% to the rat Oatp2, it is considered the mouse Oatp2 orthologue. Functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated that mouse Oatp2 transports several general Oatp substrates such as estrone-3-sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), ouabain and BQ-123 but hardly any taurocholate nor rocuronium or deltorphin II. The high-affinity rat Oatp2 substrate digoxin is transported with a rather low affinity with an apparent K(m) value of 5.7 microM. Bromosulfophthalein (BSP), a substrate not transported by the rat Oatp2, is transported very well by mouse Oatp2.

The most common mutant TTR is of the Val30Met type, which results from a point mutation. Because the major constituent of amyloid fibrils is mutant TTR, agents that selectively suppress mutant TTR expression could be powerful therapeutic tools. This study has been performed to evaluate the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for the selective silencing of mutant Val30Met TTR in cell culture systems.

8583570,Cognition and Synaptic-Plasticity Related Changes in Aged Rats Supplemented with 8- and 10-Carbon Medium Chain Triglycerides,"Brain glucose hypometabolism is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that cognition is improved by providing AD patients with an alternate energy source: ketones derived from either ketogenic diet or supplementation with medium chain triglycerides (MCT). Recently, data on the neuroprotective capacity of MCT-derived medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) suggest 8-carbon and 10-carbon MCFA may have cognition-enhancing properties which are not related to ketone production. We investigated the effect of 8 week treatment with MCT8, MCT10 or sunflower oil supplementation (5% by weight of chow diet) in 21 month old Wistar rats. Both MCT diets increased ketones plasma similarly compared to control diet, but MCT diets did not increase ketones in the brain. Treatment with MCT10, but not MCT8, significantly improved novel object recognition memory compared to control diet, while social recognition increased in both MCT groups. MCT8 and MCT10 diets decreased weight compared to control diet, where MCFA plasma levels were higher in MCT10 groups than in MCT8 groups. Both MCT diets increased IRS-1 (612) phosphorylation and decreased S6K phosphorylation (240/244) but only MCT10 increased Akt phosphorylation (473). MCT8 supplementation increased synaptophysin, but not PSD-95, in contrast MCT10 had no effect on either synaptic marker. Expression of Ube3a, which controls synaptic stability, was increased by both MCT diets. Cortex transcription via qPCR showed that immediate early genes related to synaptic plasticity (arc, plk3, junb, egr2, nr4a1) were downregulated by both MCT diets while MCT8 additionally down-regulated fosb and egr1 but upregulated grin1 and gba2. These results demonstrate that treatment of 8- and 10-carbon length MCTs in aged rats have slight differential effects on synaptic stability, protein synthesis and behavior that may be independent of brain ketone levels.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

In this proteomic study we analysed serum from a rat model of neuropathic pain obtained by the chronic constriction injury (CCI) of sciatic nerve, at two time intervals, 2 and 5 weeks after the insult, to find proteins involved in the expression or mediation of pain. Sham-operated and CCI rats were treated with saline or indomethacin. Two weeks after ligation, we identified three serum proteins overexpressed in CCI rats, two of which, alpha-1-macroglobulin and vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), remained increased 5 weeks post-surgery; at this time interval, we found increased levels of further proteins, namely apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), apolipoprotein E (APOE), prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase (PTGDS) and transthyretin (TTR), that overlap the overexpressed proteins found in humans. Indomethacin treatment reversed the effects of ligation. The qPCR analysis showed that transcript levels of APOA1, APOE, PTGDS and VDBP were overexpressed in the lumbar spinal cord (origin of sciatic nerve), but not in the striatum (an unrelated brain region), of CCI rats treated with saline 5 weeks after surgery, demonstrating that the lumbar spinal cord is a possible source of these proteins.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The expression of this transporter is up-regulated in tumor cells and rapidly-growing cells to support their proliferation. Here, we studied the expression of LAT1 and 4F2hc in human cultured cells by real-time PCR and Western blot, and found that human brain astrocytomas, U343MGa, highly expressed LAT1 and 4F2hc mRNAs and proteins. The uptake of [14C]leucine by U343MGa cells is Na+-independent and inhibited by BCH (2-amino-2-norbornane carboxylic acid), and branched and aromatic amino acids, indicating that the LAT1 is expressed at the cell surface. Pulse chase labeling and surface labeling experiments of this cell line indicate that the protein synthesis of LAT1 and 4F2hc is slow, however, the heterodimeric complex assembled in the cells is very stable, and that the disulfide bond between the LAT1 and 4F2hc is not directly involved in the stability of the heterodimer.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

MCTs 1-4 have been extensively studied and are involved in the proton-dependent transport of L-lactate, pyruvate, short-chain fatty acids, and monocarboxylate drugs in a wide variety of tissues. MCTs 1 and 4 are overexpressed in a number of cancers, and current investigations have focused on transporter inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy in cancers. MCT1 has also been used in strategies aimed at enhancing drug absorption due to its high expression in the intestine. Other MCT isoforms are less well characterized, but ongoing studies indicate that MCT6 transports xenobiotics such as bumetanide, nateglinide, and probenecid, whereas MCT7 has been characterized as a transporter of ketone bodies. MCT8 and MCT10 transport thyroid hormones, and recently, MCT9 has been characterized as a carnitine efflux transporter and MCT12 as a creatine transporter. Expressed at the blood brain barrier, MCT8 mutations have been associated with an X-linked intellectual disability, known as Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. Many MCT isoforms are associated with hormone, lipid, and glucose homeostasis, and recent research has focused on their potential roles in disease, with MCTs representing promising novel therapeutic targets. This review will provide a summary of the current literature focusing on the characterization, function, and regulation of the MCT family isoforms and on their roles in drug disposition and in health and disease.

The choroid plexus (CP) is an important target for gene therapy of neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. However, viral tropism in CP has not been well studied as a result of limited viral vector applications. To identify CP-specific viral vectors, we intracerebroventricularly administered six different serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (AAV2/1, AAV2/5, AAV2/8, AAV2/9, AAV2-BR1, and AAV2-PHP.eB) and lentivirus in adult mice. Tropism in CP was compared among these viruses. We found that AAV2/5 and AAV2/8 displayed remarkable infections in CP, while AAV2/1 infected both ependymal cells and cells in the CP. Except for the low infection intensity of AAV2/9 and lentivirus in the CP, no infection intensity was found for CP tissues injected with AAV2-BR1 or AAV2-PHP.eB. Green fluorescence protein expression in the CP after AAV2/5 infection was confirmed by Western blotting. AAV2/5-mediated tropism in epithelial cells of the CP was verified by immunostaining with transthyretin.

However, the role of HIFs in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism remains unknown. Here we show that hypoxia upregulates mRNA and protein levels of the BCAA transporter LAT1 and the BCAA metabolic enzyme BCAT1, but not their paralogs LAT2-4 and BCAT2, in human glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines as well as primary GBM cells. Hypoxia-induced LAT1 protein upregulation is mediated by both HIF-1 and HIF-2 in GBM cells. Although both HIF-1α and HIF-2α directly bind to the hypoxia response element at the first intron of the human BCAT1 gene, HIF-1α is exclusively responsible for hypoxia-induced BCAT1 expression in GBM cells. Knockout of HIF-1α and HIF-2α significantly reduces glutamate labeling from BCAAs in GBM cells under hypoxia, which provides functional evidence for HIF-mediated reprogramming of BCAA metabolism. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 inhibits GBM cell growth under hypoxia.

8582743,The Role of Transthyretin in Oligodendrocyte Development,"Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein that binds and distributes thyroid hormones (THs) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Previously, two reports identified TTR null mice as hypothyroid in the central nervous system (CNS). This prompted our investigations into developmentally regulated TH-dependent processes in brains of wildtype and TTR null mice. Despite logical expectations of a hypomyelinating phenotype in the CNS of TTR null mice, we observed a hypermyelination phenotype, synchronous with an increase in the density of oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum and anterior commissure of TTR null mice during postnatal development. Furthermore, absence of TTR enhanced proliferation and migration of OPCs with decreased apoptosis. Neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from the subventricular zone of TTR null mice at P21 revealed that the absence of TTR promoted NSC differentiation toward a glial lineage. Importantly, we identified TTR synthesis in OPCs, suggestive of an alternate biological function in these cells that may extend beyond an extracellular TH-distributor protein. The hypermyelination mechanism may involve increased pAKT (involved in oligodendrocyte maturation) in TTR null mice.

F-FDOPA accumulates inside tumor cells via the L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) whose expression is increased in gliomas. We report here a case of a histopathologically proven brain amyloidoma that was first addressed for a suspected glioma.

8582794,Plasma neurofilament light chain: an early biomarker for hereditary ATTR amyloid polyneuropathy,"Background: Transthyretin amyloidosis due to V30M mutation (ATTR-V30M) is the most frequent hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. Besides neurophysiological measures, there are no biomarkers to detect preclinical disease or monitor disease progression. CSF or plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL) have recently been considered sensitive biomarkers to quantitate neuro-axonal damage in several disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system.Objective: Characterise plasma NfL levels in a series of untreated ATTR-V30M patients stratified by clinical severity using a cross-sectional retrospective study design.Methods: Sixty ATTR-V30M patients and 16 controls from 2 independent cohorts were analysed for pNfL by single-molecule array assay (SIMOA) technique. Disease severity was assessed with Polyneuropathy Disability Score.Results: pNfL is elevated in ATTR-V30M patients as a function of disease severity in both cohorts. Moreover, pNfL discriminates asymptomatic mutation carriers from early symptomatic patients (AUC = 0.97; p < .001) with high sensitivity (92.3%) and specificity (93.8%). pNfL elevation (>66.9 pg/mL) also discriminates patients with sensory neuropathy from patients with motor neuropathy (AUC = 0.91; p < .01) with a sensitivity of 61.5% and a specificity of 92.3%.Conclusion: pNfL is an easily accessible biomarker to establish ATTR-V30M disease conversion and to monitor disease progression. pNfL could be used as efficacy measure of disease-oriented therapies in clinical and pre-clinical trials.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8582798,Transthyretin Inhibits Primary and Secondary Nucleations of Amyloid-β Peptide Aggregation and Reduces the Toxicity of Its Oligomers,"Alzheimer's disease is associated with the deposition of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) into extracellular senile plaques in the brain. In vitro and in vivo observations have indicated that transthyretin (TTR) acts as an Aβ scavenger in the brain, but the mechanism has not been fully resolved. We have monitored the aggregation process of Aβ40 by thioflavin T fluorescence, in the presence or absence of different concentrations of preformed seed aggregates of Aβ40, of wild-type tetrameric TTR (WT-TTR), and of a variant engineered to be stable as a monomer (M-TTR). Both WT-TTR and M-TTR were found to inhibit specific steps of the process of Aβ40 fibril formation, which are primary and secondary nucleations, without affecting the elongation of the resulting fibrils. Moreover, the analysis shows that both WT-TTR and M-TTR bind to Aβ40 oligomers formed in the aggregation reaction and inhibit their conversion into the shortest fibrils able to elongate. Using biophysical methods, TTR was found to change some aspects of its overall structure following such interactions with Aβ40 oligomers, as well as with oligomers of Aβ42, while maintaining its overall topology. Hence, it is likely that the predominant mechanism by which TTR exerts its protective role lies in the binding of TTR to the Aβ oligomers and in inhibiting primary and secondary nucleation processes, which limits both the toxicity of Aβ oligomers and the ability of the fibrils to proliferate.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8582835,Transthyretin immunoreactivity in choroid plexus neoplasms and brain metastases,"Although choroid plexus papillomas (CPP) and primary choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) are rare neoplasms of the central nervous system, they have been the subject of a number of immunohistochemical studies. To date, no unique or specific marker for these neoplasms has been found, however. Normal choroid plexus is a major site of transthyretin (TTR) synthesis, and recently this protein has been proposed as a possible specific marker of choroid plexus differentiation in tumors. In this study, we performed immunohistochemistry for TTR on 13 choroid plexus tumors (six CPP and seven CPC) and on 23 carcinomas metastatic to the brain, four of which had a papillary architecture. We also included four ovarian teratomas that contained choroid plexus elements. Two of the CPP had diffuse staining for TTR, while the four others stained only focally. Five of the CPC stained only focally and less intensely than the control, while one case was negative. Only one CPC stained as strongly and diffusely as normal choroid plexus. Two of the papillary and six of the nonpapillary metastases had focal staining similar to that seen in the five focally positive CPC. The choroid plexus elements of the ovarian teratomas stained as strongly as the positive control. These findings indicate that TTR immunoreactivity is not restricted to primary choroid plexus tumors. Furthermore, most choroid plexus carcinomas stain only weakly or not at all. This limits the usefulness of TTR immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of primary choroid plexus neoplasms and in the distinction of CPC from metastatic carcinoma.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to comprehensively evaluate and compare the absolute protein expression levels of transporters in the leptomeninges and plexus per cerebrum, and to determine the localizations of transporters at the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-facing and blood (dura)-facing plasma membranes of the BAB in pig. Using multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 as blood (dura)-facing and CSF-facing plasma membrane marker proteins, respectively, we established that breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 4, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 2B1, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1), and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) are localized at the blood-facing plasma membrane, and OAT3, peptide transporter (PEPT) 2, MRP3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 2, xCT, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1, MCT4, and MCT8 are localized at the CSF-facing plasma membrane of the BAB. The absolute protein expression levels of OAT1, OAT3, MDR1, BCRP, PEPT2, xCT, MATE1, OCT2, and 4f2hc in the whole BAB surrounding the entire cerebrum were much larger than those in the total of the choroid plexuses forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Although MRP4, OATP2B1, MCT8, GLUT1, and MCT1 were also statistically significantly more abundant in the BAB than in the choroid plexuses per porcine cerebrum, these transporters were nevertheless almost equally distributed between the two barriers. In contrast, OATP1A2, MRP1, OATP3A1, and OCTN2 were specifically expressed in the choroid plexus. These results should be helpful in understanding the relative overall importance of transport at the BAB compared with that at the BCSFB, as well as the rank order of transport capacities among different transporters at the BAB, and the directions of transport mediated by individual transporters. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We found that BCRP, MRP4, OATP2B1, MATE1, and GLUT1 localize at the blood-facing plasma membrane of the blood-arachnoid barrier (BAB), while OAT3, PEPT2, MRP3, OCT2, xCT, MCT1, MCT4, and MCT8 localize at the CSF-facing plasma membrane. 4F2hc is expressed in both membranes. For OAT1, OAT3, MDR1, BCRP, PEPT2, xCT, MATE1, OCT2, and 4f2hc, the absolute protein expression levels in the whole BAB surrounding the entire cerebrum are much greater than the total amounts in the choroid plexuses.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8582840,Age-related changes in cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has a key role in CSF homeostasis and preservation of normal neuronal function. There has been little investigation of changes in barrier function in elderly subjects without evidence of neurological disease. The ageing brain demonstrates increased vulnerability to a variety of insults, which may reflect a deterioration in barrier performance. Direct measurement of BBB function is difficult but the CSF/serum quotients of individual proteins is the most widely used parameter. The present study sought age related changes in the CSF/serum quotients of prealbumin, albumin, immunoglobulin G and alpha 2-macroglobulin in adults with no neurological deficit. A prospective study was established, and 107 subjects (aged 18-89 yrs) were recruited from patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia or diagnostic myelography. A weak but significant positive correlation was found between the CSF/serum quotients and age for all the proteins studied, but with the exception of alpha 2-macroglobulin, these changes probably reflect age related falls in serum protein concentrations found in this study. alpha 2-Macroglobulin appears to be a sensitive indicator of barrier function for large populations, suggesting a subtle decline of BBB integrity with increasing age.

However, it is difficult to manage heart failure itself in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Methods We herein report the management of heart failure in an elderly patient with severe heart failure due to ATTRwt. We also review the clinical situation in an additional seven patients with cardiac amyloidosis who were administered pimobendan in our hospital. Results We treated a 71-year-old man with refractory heart failure due to ATTRwt. He was expected to be dependent on dobutamine infusion. We administered pimobendan and successfully improved his symptoms and hemodynamic status to allow his discharge from the hospital. An additional retrospective investigation observed that there were eight patients with ATTR amyloidosis who were administered pimobendan. Although all of the patients at the time of administration of pimobendan were NYHA class III or IV with repeated hospitalization for heart failure, pimobendan seemed to be effective for improving symptoms and enabling patients to be discharged and receive outpatient medical care. Furthermore, focusing on the changes in some biomarkers, we found that the brain natriuretic peptide and estimated glomerular filtration rate values improved after the administration of pimobendan in 5 consecutive patients for whom data were available without additional treatment (p=0.018 and 0.051, respectively). Conclusion In clinical practice, pimobendan seems to have beneficial effects in heart failure management for improving physical activities and the quality of life in patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8582844,The transmissible amyloidoses: genetical control of spontaneous generation of infectious amyloid proteins by nucleation of configurational change in host precursors: kuru-CJD-GSS-scrapie-BSE,"Kuru, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome, scrapie, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy are caused by so-called unconventional viruses which are really replicating proteins which induce by auto nucleation and autopatterning a configurational change in the precursor protein to produce an infectious amyloid form. Crystallography and NMR may eventually determine how amyloid precursor protein is converted to this infectious form by configurational changes in all tertiary and quaternary structure of the normal precursor. Most sporadic cases of CJD arise by de novo spontaneous conversion of the normal precursor to the infectious form, a rare event occurring at the frequency of one per million persons per year (the annual incidence of CJD throughout the world). In the familial forms of CJD and GSS, where the occurrence is an autosomal dominant trait, each family has one of five different mutations causing a single amino acid change or one of five insertions of 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 octapeptide repeats. Each mutation causes a million-fold increased probability of the spontaneous configurational change to an infectious polypeptide, and appears as an autosomal dominant trait. Thus, the behavior of the transmissible brain amyloidosis parallels completely that of the transthyretin amyloidoses causing familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, in which there are 19 different point mutations, each one of which increases enormously the likelihood of configurational change of transthyretin prealbumin to amyloid.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Cerebrovascular amyloid (CVA) was found in the leptomeninges and cortices of six patients with systemic amyloidosis, including two patients with amyloid A protein (AA) amyloidosis related to serum amyloid A protein, one with AL amyloidosis related to immunoglobulin light chain (AL), two with familial type I amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), and one with senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). CVA protein from two patients with FAP reacted with anti-human prealbumin antibody similar to that of the visceral organs of these two patients. CVA in SSA reacted with anti-human prealbumin antibody and anti-beta protein antibody. Vascular amyloid was frequently noted in the pituitary glands and choroid plexuses of patients with systemic amyloidosis, and was found to be identical to that in the visceral organs (heart, kidney, and intestine) of these patients. CVA in the leptomeninges and cortices from two patients with AA amyloidosis and one with AL amyloidosis reacted with anti-beta protein monoclonal antibody but not with anti-human AA monoclonal antibody, anti-human A lambda antisera, and anti-human A kappa antisera.

8582931,An in situ-hybridization study of the localization of retinol-binding protein and transthyretin messenger RNAs during fetal development in the rat,"The patterns, and the cellular sites, of expression of the genes for retinol-binding protein (RBP) and transthyretin (TTR) were studied during early- to mid-stages of rat embryogenesis. In situ hybridization of single-stranded RNA probes to rat embryo sections revealed specific sites at which RBP messenger RNA (mRNA) and TTR mRNA were localized in rat conceptuses from 7 to 13 days of gestation. RBP and TTR mRNAs were both observed in the visceral endoderm as early as at 7 days of gestation. The transcripts were not expressed in the parietal endoderm. At 9 days of gestation, TTR mRNA was strongly detected in the visceral extraembryonic endoderm and in the foregut endoderm, whereas RBP mRNA was detected only in the visceral extraembryonic endoderm. From the 10th day to the 13th day of gestation, both transcripts were increasingly expressed in the visceral yolk sac endoderm and in the developing fetal liver, and gradually decreased in the foregut. At 11 days of gestation, TTR mRNA was first detected in the tela choroidea of the fourth ventricle in the brain; and at 13 days, the TTR mRNA was strongly evident in the developing choroid plexus of the fourth and lateral ventricles. These in situ hybridization studies with embryos at different developmental stages show that RBP and TTR mRNAs are transcribed quite early during embryogenesis.

A protein, subsequently identified as prealbumin, was noted to change in concentration over the intraoperative to 18-month postoperative time course. The qualitative changes observed on visual inspection were confirmed and quantified using laser densitometry. The concentration of prealbumin increased by an average of 90% when the intraoperative and 12-month samples were compared. This increase persisted at 18 months. The ratio of prealbumin to albumin also increased from intraoperative to 12 months by an average of 56%. This suggests that the increases in PA are the result of choroid plexus activation rather than a nonspecific breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Given the association of prealbumin with other nervous system diseases, as well as its known ability to bind multiple substances, these findings may have important implications. Alterations in prealbumin may be responsible for the improvement seen in some patients who receive adrenal medullary autotransplants.

The resulting biochemical data, hydrodynamic radii of the individual proteins investigated, and van Deurs' and Koehler's morphological findings on the existence of pores in the barrier-forming tight junctions of the choroid plexus epithelium could be surprisingly well correlated with one another, although these morphological findings were obtained in choroid plexus of the rat brain.

8582983,Characterization of interaction between nuclear T3 receptors and antiserum against cellular-erb A peptide,"In our previous study, we raised a polyclonal antiserum against a synthetic 15 amino acid peptide encoding the putative hormone binding domain of c-erb A, which not only inhibited T3-binding to rat liver nuclear T3 receptor (NT3R) but also immunoprecipitated [125I]T3-NT3R complex. In the present study, interactions between this antiserum (4 BII-immunoglobulin G (IgG] and NT3R were further characterized. 4BII-IgG interefered T3 from binding to rat liver NT3R both in the nuclear extract and in isolated nuclei in a similar manner. Preincubation with 4BII-IgG decreased the association constant value with no effect on maximal binding capacity of NT3R. Lineweaver-Burk plot revealed competitive inhibition of T3-NT3R binding. Both the inhibition of T3 binding and immunoprecipitation of NT3R by the antiserum were similarly observed with rat liver, kidney, brain, and testis, and human kidney nuclear extract. Since the polypeptide sequence which was used for immunization is highly homologous between c-erb A alpha 1 and beta, it is likely that 4BII-IgG recognizes both c-erb A alpha 1 and beta in various tissues. On the contrary, 4BII-IgG did not interfere with T3 binding to rat liver cytosol T3-binding protein and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) prepared from human serum, nor immunoprecipitated these binding proteins labeled with [125I]T3. The binding protein for reverse T3 (NrT3BP) in the rat liver nuclear extract was neither immunoprecipitated nor influenced in its rT3-binding activity by 4BII-IgG. When the immune complex between the nuclear extract and 4BII-IgG was removed by antirabbit IgG goat serum, the remaining T3-binding activity was reduced by 87%, while no rT3-binding activity was immunodepleted, suggesting that NrT3BP is a protein different from NT3R.

The samples were analyzed for free amino acids and for soluble proteins. The results were compared with corresponding data on extracellular fluid from the brain surface obtained with dialysis-perfusion as well as with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acquired by lumbar punction. The dialysis data were calibrated against the paper results. The choroid plexus secretion had a high concentration of transthyretin as well as of an unidentified protein with an isoelectric point of 7.4. The cortical ECF exhibited high concentrations of tau-globulin and gamma-trace protein. Among the amino acids, glutamine had lower concentration in the choroid plexus secretion and higher concentrations in the ECF of the brain compared to the CSF. The amino acid derivative ethanolamine exhibited a similar pattern. This was interpreted to demonstrate that these compounds enter the CSF from the brain tissue.

Prealbumin mRNAs were detected in the total RNAs from liver and choroid plexus of brain, but not in those from brain, heart, kidney, and thyroid gland. The level of prealbumin mRNA in the choroid plexus was about 100-fold higher than that in the liver. We detected no differences in the sizes of prealbumin mRNAs in the liver and choroid plexus of the control subject, or in those of the individual with FAP, and found that the prealbumin mRNAs in these tissues had been transcribed from a common transcription initiation site. The levels of prealbumin mRNAs in the livers of four control subjects and those of six individuals with FAP were much the same. Because all the individuals with FAP so far examined were heterozygous for the prealbumin gene, carrying one normal and one mutant gene, the levels of the normal and mutant prealbumin mRNAs in the liver and the brain tissue containing choroid plexus were separately estimated and were found to be approximately equal.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

By Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization experiments with mouse embryos and adult tissues, we first detected C/EBP mRNA in hepatocytes at the 13th gestational day, when no other cell types give detectable signals and thus by this test C/EBP is, at least in the embryo, a 'liver-specific' factor. Only trace amounts of C/EBP were seen in the yolk sac and no mRNA was detectable in choroid plexus in either embryos or adult animals. Both these cell types produce some proteins (e.g. albumin, transthyretin, alpha-1 antitrypsin and others) that are also made in the liver where C/EBP is important for their production; thus either fewer factors or different factors govern yolk sac and choroid plexus production of these proteins. C/EBP mRNA was not detected in fetal brain but was present in several regions of the adult mouse brain again emphasizing that this factor does not appear to have a very early embryologic role.

Highly sulfated PGs were specifically localized to the amyloid fibril of the neuritic plaque and the paired filaments of the neurofibrillary tangle. This demonstrates that highly sulfated PGs either comprise part of the Alzheimer's amyloid fibril and paired filament or are intimately associated with them. Four unrelated types of amyloid--AA (inflammation-associated), AL (immunoglobulin light chain), senile cardiac (prealbumin) and medullary carcinoma-associated amyloid (procalcitonin)--showed an identical pattern of localization of highly sulfated PG to the different amyloid fibrils.

The L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) has been one of the most extensively investigated transporters for delivering drugs across biological barriers. The transporter is predominantly expressed in cerebral cortex, blood-brain barrier, blood-retina barrier, testis, placenta, bone marrow and several types of cancer. Its physiological function is to mediate Na+ and pH independent exchange of essential amino acids: leucine, phenylalanine, etc. Several drugs and prodrugs designed as LAT1 substrates have been developed to improve targeted delivery into the brain and cancer cells. Thus, the anti-parkinsonian drug, L-Dopa, the anti-cancer drug, melphalan and the anti-epileptic drug gabapentin, all used in clinical practice, utilize LAT1 to reach their target site. These examples provide supporting evidence for the utility of the LAT1-mediated targeted delivery of the (pro)drug.

8582722,Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 Deficiency: Delayed or Permanent Hypomyelination?,"Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency or the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS) is an X-linked psychomotor disability syndrome with around 320 clinical cases described worldwide. SLC16A2 gene mutations, encoding the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter MCT8, result in intellectual disability due to impaired TH uptake in the developing brain. MCT8 deficiency is a multi-organ affecting disease with a predominant neuronal cell-based pathology, with the glial component inadequately investigated. However, deficiency in myelin, a key component of white matter (WM) enabling fast nerve conduction, is a TH-dependent hallmark of the disease. Nevertheless, analysis of the myelin status in AHDS patients has led to conflicting interpretations. The majority of individual case studies reported delayed myelination, that was restored later in life. In contrast, post-mortem studies and high-resolution MRIs detected WM (micro-) abnormalities throughout adolescence, suggesting permanent hypomyelination. Thus, interpretations vary depending on methodology to investigate WM microstructure. Further, it is unknown whether the mutation within the MCT8 is linked to the severity of the myelin deficiency. Consequently, terminology is inconsistent among reports, and AHDS is occasionally misdiagnosed as another WM disorder. The evolutionary conserved TH signaling pathway that promotes the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes enabled deciphering how the lack of MCT8 might affect myelinogenesis. Linking patient findings on myelination to those obtained from models of MCT8 deficiency revealed underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, but knowledge gaps remain, notably how myelination progresses both spatially and temporally in MCT8 deficiency. This limits predicting how myelin integrity might benefit therapeutically, and when to initiate. A recurrent observation in clinical trials is the absence of neurological improvement. Testing MCT8-independent thyromimetics in models, and evaluating treatments used in other demyelinating diseases, despite different etiologies, is crucial to propose new therapeutic strategies combatting this devastating disease.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Disrupted ventricular/subventricular zone progenitors and stem cells lead to CNS maldevelopment. Exploring models, we organ cultured the CP and transplanted fresh CP into a lateral ventricle of postnatal hydrocephalic (hyHTx) and nonhydrocephalic (nHTx) rats. After 60 days in vitro, the cultured choroid ependyma formed spherical rings with beating cilia. Cultured CP expressed endocytotic caveolin 1 and apical aquaporin 1 and absorbed horseradish peroxidase from medium. Transthyretin secretory protein was secreted by organ-cultured CP into medium throughout 60 days in vitro. Fresh CP, surviving at 1 week after lateral ventricle implantation of nHTx or hyHTx did not block CSF flow. Avascular 1-week transplants in vivo expressed caveolin 1, aquaporin 1, and transthyretin, indicating that grafted CP may secrete trophic proteins but not CSF. Our findings encourage further exploration on CP organ culture and grafting for translational strategies. Because transplanted CP, though not producing CSF, may secrete beneficial molecules for developing brain injured by hydrocephalus, we propose that upon CP removal in hydrocephalus surgery, the fractionated tissue could be transplanted back (ventricular autograft).",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8580226,Mechanistic study on the use of the l-type amino acid transporter 1 for brain intracellular delivery of ketoprofen via prodrug: A novel approach supporting the development of prodrugs for intracellular targets,"l-Type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), selectively expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain parenchymal cells, mediates brain delivery of drugs and prodrugs such as l-dopa and gabapentin. Although knowledge about BBB transport of LAT1-utilizing prodrugs is available, there is a lack of quantitative information about brain intracellular delivery and influence of prodrugs on the transporter's physiological state. We studied the LAT1-mediated intrabrain distribution of a recently developed prodrug of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ketoprofen as well as its impact on transporter protein expression and function (i.e., amino acid exchange) using brain slice method in mice and rats. The intrabrain distribution of the prodrug was 16 times higher than that of ketoprofen. LAT1 involvement in brain cellular barrier uptake of the prodrug was confirmed, reflected by a higher unbound brain intracellular compared to brain extracellular fluid concentration. The prodrug did not alter LAT1 protein expression and amino acid exchange. Integration of derived parameters with previously performed in vivo pharmacokinetic study using the Combinatory Mapping Approach allowed to estimate the brain extra- and intracellular levels of unbound ketoprofen, prodrug, and released parent drug. The overall efficiency of plasma to brain intracellular delivery of prodrug-released ketoprofen was 11 times higher than after ketoprofen dosing.

However, atrial fibrillation (AF), a recognised risk factor for ischemic CNS complications, is also observed after LTx. The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence of CNS complications and AF in LTx ATTRm amyloidosis patients.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The medical records of all LTx ATTRm amyloidosis patients in the county of Västerbotten, Sweden, were investigated for information on CNS complications, AF, anticoagulation (AC) therapy, hypertension, cardiac ischemic disease, hypertrophy, and neurological status.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Sixty-three patients that had survived for 3 years or longer after LTx were included in the analysis. Twenty-five patients had developed 1 or more CNS complications at a median of 21 years after onset of disease. AF was noted in 21 patients (median time to diagnosis 24 years). Cerebrovascular events (CVE) developed in 17 (median time to event 21 years). CVEs occurred significantly more often in patients with AF (P < 0.002). AC therapy significantly reduced CVEs, including bleeding in patients with AF (P = 0.04). Multivariate analysis identified AF as the only remaining regressor with a significant impact on CVE (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval 1.1-9.5; P = 0.029).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>AF is an important risk factor for CVE in LTx ATTRm amyloidosis patients, and AC therapy should be considered.

8580325,Transthyretin participates in beta-amyloid transport from the brain to the liver--involvement of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1?,"Transthyretin (TTR) binds Aβ peptide, preventing its deposition and toxicity. TTR is decreased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Additionally, AD transgenic mice with only one copy of the TTR gene show increased brain and plasma Aβ levels when compared to AD mice with both copies of the gene, suggesting TTR involvement in brain Aβ efflux and/or peripheral clearance. Here we showed that TTR promotes Aβ internalization and efflux in a human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line, hCMEC/D3. TTR also stimulated brain-to-blood but not blood-to-brain Aβ permeability in hCMEC/D3, suggesting that TTR interacts directly with Aβ at the blood-brain-barrier. We also observed that TTR crosses the monolayer of cells only in the brain-to-blood direction, as confirmed by in vivo studies, suggesting that TTR can transport Aβ from, but not into the brain. Furthermore, TTR increased Aβ internalization by SAHep cells and by primary hepatocytes from TTR+/+ mice when compared to TTR-/- animals. We propose that TTR-mediated Aβ clearance is through LRP1, as lower receptor expression was found in brains and livers of TTR-/- mice and in cells incubated without TTR.

8580351,Mct8-deficient mice have increased energy expenditure and reduced fat mass that is abrogated by normalization of serum T3 levels,"Children with monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency lose weight, even when adequately nourished. Changes in serum markers of thyroid hormone (TH) action compatible with thyrotoxicosis suggested that this might be due to T3 excess in peripheral tissues. Mct8-deficient mice (Mct8KO) replicate the human thyroid phenotype and are thus suitable for metabolic studies so far unavailable in humans. In the current work, compared with wild-type (Wt) mice, Mct8KO mice were leaner due to reduced fat mass. They tended to use more carbohydrates and fewer lipids during the dark phase. Mct8KO mice had increased total energy expenditure (TEE) and food and water intake, with normal total activity, indicating hypermetabolism. To determine whether this is due to the high serum T3, we studied mice deficient in both Mct8 and deiodinase 1 (Mct8D1KO) with serum T3 similar to Wt mice and Wt mice given L-T3 to raise their serum T3 to the level of Mct8KO mice. Contrary to Mct8KO, Mct8D1KO mice had similar fat mass, TEE, and food intake as their D1KO littermates, whereas T3-treated Wt mice showed increased food intake and TEE, similar to Mct8KO mice. In skeletal muscle, Mct8KO mice had increased T3 content and TH action and increased glucose metabolism, which improved in Mct8D1KO mice. These studies indicate that the high serum T3 in MCT8 deficiency increases the TEE and fails to maintain weight despite adequate calorie intake. This is mediated by tissues that are not predominantly MCT8 dependent for TH transport, including skeletal muscle.

A proton MRSI study,"<strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>To assess brain metabolic abnormalities in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) due to the transthyretin (TTR) gene mutations.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>The TTR-FAP has variable phenotypic expression, which includes abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS). Several conventional MRI studies have shown brain abnormalities, probably secondary to amyloid accumulation in leptomeningeal and subarachnoid vessels. However, TTR-related amyloid deposits do not seem to significantly affect the brain parenchyma and a prominent CNS impairment is considered to be rare in TTR amyloidosis.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>We performed proton MR spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) in the central brain of four unrelated TTR-FAP patients with either minimal or no signs of neurological involvement and eight age- and sex-matched normal controls (NC). Metabolic changes were assessed in the entire volume of interest (VOI) and in the frontal, periventricular and posterior white matter (WM).<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Conventional MRI was normal in 2 patients and showed minimal WM lesions in the remaining 2 patients. 1H-MRSI showed N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio (NAA/Cr) decreases in the central brain VOI in all TTR-FAP patients (p < 0.005). These NAA/Cr decreases were homogeneous in all WM regions (p < 0.05 for all).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>1H-MRSI findings suggest that diffuse metabolic changes, probably related to axonal damage, are present in brains of TTR-FAP patients even when they have no or minimal clinical and MRI signs of CNS involvement.

Conditioned medium was collected for western analysis at this time. Total RNA was also extracted from RPE/choroid freshly dissected from monkey eyes. Using cDNA probes for human TTR and RBP, northern analysis was performed on the total RNA from fresh and cultured RPE samples, together with poly(A+) mRNA purified from monkey liver and brain.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Conditioned medium from RPE yielded TTR protein of the expected monomer subunit molecular size. The TTR secreted de novo from the cultured cells was detectable in the absence of biosynthetic labeling. With the exception of some extremely low abundance transcripts expressed in cultured RPE, all samples contained a single 900 bp transcript for TTR. Based on relative amounts of actual message, RPE ranks higher than liver in abundance of TTR mRNA. In contrast, both native monkey RPE and cultured RPE cells expressed comparatively low levels of mRNA for RBP. All samples displayed a single RBP mRNA transcript at 1100 bp.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Our results indicate that TTR is a significant gene product of the RPE, and may be considered as a marker for a differentiated phenotype for these cells in culture.

We studied the changes in the CSF proteome in rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model.

According to hierarchical cluster analysis by self-organising tree algorism (SOTA), the temporal pattern of protein peaks was divided into four groups: acute increase group, chronic increase group, gradual decrease group and unchanged group. In the acute increase group, the expression of a 13.6-kDa protein was markedly increased during the acute phase. The 13.6-kDa protein was identified as monomeric form of transthyretin using two-dimensional electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.

The hypothesis that brain amino acid transport activity can be altered with single nucleotide polymorphisms was tested in the present studies with site-directed mutagenesis of the BBB LAT1. The rabbit has a high Km LAT1 large neutral amino acid transporter, as compared to the low Km neutral amino acid transporter at the human or rat BBB. The rabbit LAT1 was cloned from a rabbit brain capillary cDNA library. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of rabbit, human, and rat LAT1 revealed two radical amino acid residues that differ in the rabbit relative to the rat or human LAT1. The G219D mutation had a modest effect on the Km and Vmax of tryptophan transport via cloned rabbit LAT1 in frog oocytes, but the W234L variant reduced the Km by 64% and the Vmax by 96%. Conversely, LAT1 transport of either tryptophan or phenylalanine was nearly normalized when the double mutation W234L/G219D variant was produced.

Traditionally, treatment options for light chain (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis have been limited. However, there are now multiple novel therapeutics in development and several therapeutics recently approved that promise to revolutionize clinical management of AL and ATTR. Most of these agents disrupt specific stages of amyloidogenesis such as light chain or transthyretin protein production, formation of amyloidogenic intermediates, or amyloid fibril aggregation. Others aim to remove existing amyloid tissue deposits using monoclonal antibody technology.

All infants were followed up for 6 months. The observation indices included body height, body weight, prealbumin, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide before surgery, at the time of ventilator weaning and extubation after surgery, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery.

8582504,Drug delivery strategies to overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB),"The brain capillary endothelium serves both as an exchange site for gases and solutes between blood and brain and as a protective fence against neurotoxic compounds from the blood. While this ""blood-brain barrier"" (BBB) function protects the fragile environment in the brain, it also poses a tremendous challenge for the delivery of drug compounds to the brain parenchyma. Paracellular brain uptake of drug compounds is limited by the physical tightness of the endothelium, which is tightly sealed with junction complexes. Transcellular uptake of lipophilic drug compounds is limited by the activity of active efflux pumps in the luminal membrane. As a result, the majority of registered CNS drug compounds are small lipophilic compounds which are not efflux transporter substrates. Small molecule CNS drug development therefore focuses on identifying compounds with CNS target affinity and modifies these in order to optimize lipophilicity and decrease efflux pump interactions. Since efflux pump activity is limiting drug uptake, it has been investigated whether coadministration of drug compounds with efflux pump inhibitors could increase drug uptake. While the concept works to some extent, a lot of challenges have been encountered in terms of obtaining efficient inhibition while avoiding adverse effects.Some CNS drug compounds enter the brain via nutrient transport proteins, an example is the levodopa, a prodrug of Dopamine, which crosses the BBB via the large neutral amino acid transporter LAT1. While carrier-mediated transport of drug compounds may seem attractive, the development of drugs targeting transporters is very challenging, since the compounds should have a good fit to the binding site, while still maintaining their CNS target affinity.Receptor-mediated transport of drug compounds, especially biotherapeutics, conjugated to a receptor-binding ligand has shown some promise, although the amounts transported are rather low. This also holds true for drug-conjugation to cell-penetrating peptides. Due to the low uptake of biotherapeutics, barrier-breaching approaches such as mannitol injections and focused ultrasound have been employed with some success to patient groups with no other treatment options.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
8582512,Targeting transthyretin - Mechanism-based treatment approaches and future perspectives in hereditary amyloidosis,"The liver-derived, circulating transport protein transthyretin (TTR) is the cause of systemic hereditary (ATTRv) and wild-type (ATTRwt) amyloidosis. TTR stabilization and knockdown are approved therapies to mitigate the otherwise lethal disease course. To date, the variety in phenotypic penetrance is not fully understood. This systematic review summarizes the current literature on TTR pathophysiology with its therapeutic implications. Tetramer dissociation is the rate-limiting step of amyloidogenesis. Besides destabilizing TTR mutations, other genetic (RBP4, APCS, AR, ATX2, C1q, C3) and external (extracellular matrix, Schwann cell interaction) factors influence the type of onset and organ tropism. The approved small molecule tafamidis stabilizes the tetramer and significantly decelerates the clinical course. By sequence-specific mRNA knockdown, the approved small interfering RNA (siRNA) patisiran and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inotersen both significantly reduce plasma TTR levels and improve neuropathy and quality of life compared to placebo. With enhanced hepatic targeting capabilities, GalNac-conjugated siRNA and ASOs have recently entered phase III clinical trials. Bivalent TTR stabilizers occupy both binding groves in vitro, but have not been tested in trials so far. Tolcapone is another stabilizer with the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, but its half-life is short and liver failure a potential side effect. Amyloid-directed antibodies and substances like doxycycline aim at reducing the amyloid load, however, none of the yet developed antibodies has successfully passed clinical trials. ATTR-amyloidosis has become a model disease for pathophysiology-based treatment.

Though there have been numerous reports of LAT1-targeted amino acid-drug conjugates (prodrugs), identifying the structural determinants to enhance substrate activity has been challenging. In this work, we investigated the position and orientation of a carbonyl group in linking hydrophobic moieties including the anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen to l-tyrosine and l-phenylalanine. We found that esters of meta-carboxyl l-phenylalanine had better LAT1 transport rates than the corresponding acylated l-tyrosine analogues. However, as the size of the hydrophobic moiety increased, we observed a decrease in LAT1 transport rate with a concomitant increase in potency of inhibition.

8582530,Probenecid Increases the Concentration of 7-Chlorokynurenic Acid Derived from the Prodrug 4-Chlorokynurenine within the Prefrontal Cortex,"Recent advances in the understanding of depression have led to increasing interest in ketamine and the role that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor inhibition plays in depression. l-4-Chlorokynurenine (4-Cl-KYN, AV-101), a prodrug, has shown promise as an antidepressant in preclinical studies, but this promise has not been realized in recent clinical trials. We sought to determine if transporters in the CNS could be playing a role in this clinical response. We used radiolabeled uptake assays and microdialysis studies to determine how 4-Cl-KYN and its active metabolite, 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to access the brain and its extracellular fluid compartment. Our data indicates that 4-Cl-KYN crosses the blood-brain barrier via the amino acid transporter LAT1 (SLC7A5) after which the 7-Cl-KYNA metabolite leaves the brain extracellular fluid via probenecid-sensitive organic anion transporters OAT1/3 (SLC22A6 and SLC22A8) and MRP4 (ABCC4). Microdialysis studies further validated our in vitro data, indicating that probenecid may be used to boost the bioavailability of 7-Cl-KYNA. Indeed, we found that coadministration of 4-Cl-KYN with probenecid caused a dose-dependent increase by as much as an 885-fold increase in 7-Cl-KYNA concentration in the prefrontal cortex. In summary, our data show that 4-Cl-KYN crosses the BBB using LAT1, while its active metabolite, 7-Cl-KYNA, is rapidly transported out of the brain via OAT1/3 and MRP4. We also identify a hitherto unreported mechanism by which the brain extracellular concentration of 7-Cl-KYNA may be increased to produce significant boosting of the drug concentration at its site of action that could potentially lead to an increased therapeutic effect.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

There is a need for predictive human in vitro models of the BBB to enable studies of brain drug delivery. Here, we investigated whether human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line (BIONi010-C) could be differentiated to brain capillary endothelial- like cells (BCEC) and evaluated their potential use in drug delivery studies. BIONi010-C hIPSCs were differentiated according to established protocols. BCEC monolayers displayed transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values of 5,829±354 Ω∙cm2, a Papp,mannitol of 1.09±0.15 ∙ 10-6 cm∙s-1 and a Papp,diazepam of 85.7 ± 5.9 ∙ 10-6 cm ∙s-1. The Pdiazepam/Pmannitol ratio of ~80, indicated a large dynamic passive permeability range. Monolayers maintained their integrity after medium exchange. Claudin-5, Occludin, Zonulae Occludens 1 and VE-Cadherin were expressed at the cell-cell contact zones. Efflux transporters were present at the mRNA level, but functional efflux of substrates was not detected. Transferrin-receptor (TFR), Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and Basigin receptors were expressed at the mRNA-level. The presence and localization of TFR and LRP1 were verified at the protein level. A wide range of BBB-expressed solute carriers (SLC's) were detected at the mRNA level. The presence and localization of SLC transporters GLUT1 and LAT1 was verified at the protein level. Functional studies revealed transport of the LAT1 substrate [3H]-L-Leucine and the LRP1 substrate angiopep-2. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that BIONi010-C-derived BCEC monolayers exhibited, BBB properties including barrier tightness and integrity, a high dynamic range, expression of some of the BBB receptor and transporter expression, as well as functional transport of LAT1 and LRP1 substrates. This suggests that BIONi010-C-derived BCEC monolayers may be useful for studying the roles of LAT-1 and LRP1 in brain drug delivery.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

8583559,Cognitive Dysfunction and Malnutrition Are Independent Predictor of Dysphagia in Patients with Acute Exacerbation of Congestive Heart Failure,"Early detection and intervention for dysphagia is important in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). However, previous studies have focused on how many patients with dysphagia develop CHF. Studies focusing on the comorbidity of dysphagia in patients with CHF are rare. Additionally, risk factors for dysphagia in patients with CHF are unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to clarify risk factors for dysphagia in patients with acute exacerbation of CHF. A total of 105 patients, who were admitted with acute exacerbation of CHF, were enrolled. Clinical interviews, blood chemistry analysis, electrocardiography, echocardiography, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), exercise tolerance tests, phonatory function tests, and evaluation of activities of daily living (ADL) and nutrition were conducted on admission. After attending physicians permitted the drinking of water, swallowing screening tests were performed. Patients were divided into a dysphagia group (DG) or a non-dysphagia group (non-DG) based on Functional Oral Intake Scale level. Among the 105 patients, 38 had dysphagia. A greater number of patients had history of aspiration pneumonia and dementia, and there was a higher age, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level in the DG compared with the non-DG. MMSE scores, exercise tolerance, phonatory function, status of ADL, nutrition, albumin, and transthyretin were lower in the DG compared with the non-DG. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age and sex, MMSE, BI score, and transthyretin was independently associated with dysphagia.

About 20% of the protein newly synthesized in choroid plexus and about 50% of the newly synthesized protein secreted into the medium was transthyretin. Evidently, the choroid plexus is very active in the biosynthesis of this carrier protein for thyroid hormones and could be an important link in the chemical communication between the body and the central nervous system. Acute inflammation, which leads to a profound rearrangement of the pattern of plasma protein synthesis rates in the liver, produced distinct changes in the levels for plasma protein mRNAs in the liver. The levels of the mRNAs for alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and major acute phase alpha 1-protein increased more than 30-fold, those for transthyretin and albumin decreased to 27 and 57% of normal, respectively. The pattern of the observed changes in the levels of mRNAs for plasma proteins in the liver was independent of whether the acute inflammation was produced by subcutaneous injection of turpentine or intraperitoneal injection of a suspension of talcum. However, levels of transthyretin mRNA in choroid plexus were affected only very slightly, or not at all. Apparently, transthyretin synthesis in liver and choroid plexus is regulated independently during the acute phase response. No mRNA was detected in choroid plexus for albumin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and major acute phase alpha 1-protein under any conditions.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Alterations of the NO/cGMP pathway and increased glutamine (Gln) content are collectively responsible for many HE symptoms, but how the two events influence each other is not clear. Previously we had shown that Gln administered intracerebrally inhibited the NO/cGMP pathway in control rats and even more so in rats with HA, and we speculated that this effect is due to inhibition by Gln of arginine (Arg) transport (Hilgier et al., 2009). In this study we demonstrate that a 3-day HA in the ammonium acetate model increases the expression in the brain of y(+)LAT2, the heteromeric transporter which preferentially stimulates Arg efflux from the cells in exchange for Gln. The expression of the basic amino acid transporter CAT1, transporting Arg but not Gln remained unaffected by HA. Multiple parameters of Arg or Gln uptake and/or efflux and their mutual dependence were altered in the cerebral cortical slices obtained from HA rats, in a manner indicating enhanced y(+)LAT2-mediated transport. HA elevated Gln content and decreased cGMP content as measured both in the cerebral cortical tissue and microdialysates. Intracortical administration of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), which inhibits Gln fluxes between different cells of the CNS, attenuated the HA-induced decrease of cGMP in the microdialysates of HA rats, but not of control rats. The results suggest that, reduced delivery of Arg due to enhanced y(+)LAT2-mediated exchange of extracellular Gln for intracellular Arg may contribute to the decrease of NO/cGMP pathway activity evoked in the brain by HA.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The AD model was established by bilateral hippocampal injection of Aβ1-42(5 µL). The AM was applied at ""Baihui"" (GV 20) and ""Shenshu"" (BL 23) for 15 min, once daily for 12 times. Morris water maze tests were used to assess the rats' learning-memory ability. The levels of serum Aβ1-42 and Aβ internalizing enzymes including transthyretin (TTR), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), alpha 2 macroglobulin (α 2M) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) were detected by ELISA. The expression of Aβ1-42 in the hippocampal DG was detected by immunohistochemistry.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Compared with the sham operation group, the average escape latency of location navigation test was significantly prolonged in the first 5 days and the last 3 days (P<0.01), and the residence time of the target-quadrant and the platform crossing times of special probing task were significantly reduced in the model group (P<0.01). After the intervention, the average escape latency was obviously shortened in the first 5 days and the last 3 days (P<0.01), and both the residence time and the platform crossing times were significantly increased in the AM group relevant to the model group (P<0.01, P<0.05). After modeling, the contents of TTR, LPL, α 2M and ApoE in the serum were significantly lower in the model group than in the sham operation group (P<0.01, P<0.05), while the levels of serum Aβ1-42 and hippocampal Aβ1-42 expression were considerably increased relevant to the sham operation group (P<0.01). Following the intervention, the TTR, LPL, α2M and ApoE contents in the serum were significantly increased (P<0.01, P<0.05), and both serum Aβ1-42 and hippocampal Aβ1-42 expression were notably down-regulated in comparison with the model group (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the normal and sham operation groups in the levels of all the above-mentioned indexes (P>0.05).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>AM can improve the learning-memory ability of AD rats, which may be related to its effects in up-regulating the contents of serum Aβ internalizing enzymes and promoting the clearance of hippocampal Aβ.

8583337,Nicotine Acts on Cholinergic Signaling Mechanisms to Directly Modulate Choroid Plexus Function,"Neuronal cholinergic circuits have been implicated in cognitive function and neurological disease, but the role of cholinergic signaling in other cellular populations within the brain has not been as fully defined. Here, we show that cholinergic signaling mechanisms are involved in mediating the function of the choroid plexus, the brain structure responsible for generating CSF and releasing various factors into the brain. The choroid plexus was found to express markers of endogenous cholinergic signaling, including multiple nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes in a region-specific manner, and application of nicotine was found to induce cellular activation, as evidenced by calcium influx in primary tissue. During intravenous nicotine self-administration in male rats, nicotine increased expression of transthyretin, a protein selectively produced and released by the choroid plexus, and microRNA-204 (mir-204), a transcript found in high levels in the choroid plexus and CSF. Finally, human choroid plexus tissue from both sexes was found to exhibit similar nAChR, transthyretin and mir-204 expression profiles, supporting the translational relevance of the findings. Together, these studies demonstrate functionally active cholinergic signaling mechanisms in the choroid plexus, the resulting effects on transthyretin and mir-204 expression, and reveal the direct mechanism by which nicotine modulates function of this tissue.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Previously, our group reported that iso-α-acids (IAAs), which are hop-derived bitter components present in beer, prevent inflammation and cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer's disease model mice (5xFAD mice) and yield significant reduction in amyloid β (Αβ) in the brain. However, data on the molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological effects of IAAs remain limited. Here, we used transcriptome analysis and found that oral administration of IAAs to 5xFAD mice for 7 days induces a 58.9-fold increase in the expression of transthyretin (TTR; Ttr) in the hippocampus compared with controls. In addition, real-time quantitative PCR showed that oral administration of IAAs significantly increased Ttr transcription in the hippocampi of wild type C57BL/6J mice but not in the cerebral cortex. TTR is an Αβ protein scavenger; thus, an increase in its expression could prevent amyloid aggregate formation.

8583343,Hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis,"Hereditary transthyretin(TTR)-related amyloidosis (ATTRm amyloidosis) is an endemic/non-endemic, autosomal-dominant, early- and late-onset, rare, progressive disorder, predominantly manifesting as length-dependent, small fiber dominant, axonal polyneuropathy and frequently associated with cardiac disorders and other multisystem diseases. ATTRm amyloidosis is due to variants in the TTR gene, with the substitution Val30Met as the most frequent mutation. TTR mutations lead to destabilization and dissociation of TTR tetramers into variant TTR monomers, and formation of amyloid fibrils, which are consecutively deposited extracellularly in various tissues, such as nerves, heart, brain, eyes, intestines, kidneys, or the skin. Neuropathy may not only include large nerve fibers but also small fibers, and not only sensory and motor fibers but also autonomic fibers. Types of TTR variants, age at onset, penetrance, and clinical presentation vary between geographical areas. Suggestive of a ATTRm amyloidosis are a sensorimotor polyneuropathy, positive family history, autonomic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, unexplained weight loss, and resistance to immunotherapy. If only sensory A-delta or C fibers are affected, small fiber neuropathy ensues. Diagnostic tests for small fiber neuropathy include determination of intraepidermal nerve fiber density, laser-evoked potentials, heat- and cold-detection thresholds, and measurement of the electrochemical skin conductance.

LAT1 is highly expressed at the blood brain barrier (BBB) and in numerous cancer cells and is therefore a potential drug target. However, structural features affecting the ability to bind to LAT1 and the cellular translocation by LAT1 are unclear. In the present study we determined the binding to and transport through human LAT1 of several compounds into the human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). We show that the meta-conjugation of l-phenylalanine increases binding to human LAT1 compared to para-conjugation or aliphatic amino acid moiety. Furthermore, large, rigid and aromatic meta-substituted l-phenylalanine derivative enabled selective and efficient LAT1-mediated cellular uptake. Our results also demonstrates that in addition to binding studies, it is of utmost importance to determine the cellular accumulation of compounds. It provides crucial information on transport efficiency and selectivity of transport mechanisms that the compounds are able to utilize.

8583348,Mutated thyroid hormone transporter OATP1C1 associates with severe brain hypometabolism and juvenile neurodegeneration,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for brain development and function. The TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and organic anion transporter1 C1 (OATP1C1) facilitate the transport of TH across the blood-brain barrier and into glia and neuronal cells in the brain. Loss of MCT8 function causes Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS, OMIM 300523) characterized by severe intellectual and motor disability due to cerebral hypothyroidism. Here, the first patient with loss of OATP1C1 function is described. The patient is a 15.5-year-old girl with normal development in the first year of life, who gradually developed dementia with spasticity and intolerance to cold. Brain imaging demonstrated gray and white matter degeneration and severe glucose hypometabolism. METHODS: Exome sequencing of the patient and parents was performed to identify the disease-causing mutation, and the effect of the mutation was studied through a panel of in vitro experiments, including thyroxine uptake studies, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, the clinical effects of treatment with the triiodothyronine analogue triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac) are described. RESULTS: Exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation in OATP1C1, changing the highly conserved aspartic acid 252 to asparagine (D252N). In vitro, the mutated OATP1C1 displays impaired plasma membrane localization and decreased cellular thyroxine uptake. After treatment with Triac, the clinical condition improved in several domains.

However, radiation is well-known to induce several unexpected side effects including emotional disorders. Although radiation-induced depression may cause decreased quality of life after radiotherapy, investigations of its molecular mechanism and therapeutic strategies are still insufficient. In this study, we found that behavioral symptoms of depression on mice models with the decrease of BrdU/NeuN- and Dcx-positive populations and MAP-2 expression in hippocampus were induced by cranial irradiation, and transthyretin (TTR) was highly expressed in hippocampus after irradiation. It was shown that overexpression of TTR resulted in the inhibition of retinol-mediated neuritogenesis. PAK1 phosphorylation and MAP-2 expression were significantly reduced by TTR overexpression following irradiation. Moreover, we observed that treatment of allantoin and neferine, the active components of Nelumbo nucifera, interrupted irradiation-induced TTR overexpression, consequently leading to the increase of PAK1 phosphorylation, neurite extension, BrdU/NeuN- and Dcx-positive populations, and MAP-2 expression. Behavioral symptoms of depression following cranial irradiation were also relieved by treatment of allantoin and neferine.

To utilize LAT1 for drug delivery, potent amino acid promoieties are desired, as prodrugs must compete with millimolar concentrations of endogenous amino acids. To better understand ligand-transporter interactions that could improve potency, we developed structural LAT1 models to guide the design of substituted analogues of phenylalanine and histidine. Furthermore, we evaluated the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for both enantiomers of naturally occurring LAT1 substrates. Analogues were tested in cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation cell assays to determine potency and uptake rate. Surprisingly, LAT1 can transport amino acid-like substrates with wide-ranging polarities including those containing ionizable substituents. Additionally, the rate of LAT1 transport was generally nonstereoselective even though enantiomers likely exhibit different binding modes.

Delayed diagnosis has a detrimental effect on treatment and prognosis. To facilitate diagnosis, we analyzed data patterns of patients with transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) and compared them to polyneuropathies of different etiology for clinical and electrophysiological discriminators.<br /><br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Twenty-four patients with TTR-FAP and 48 patients with diabetic polyneuropathy (dPNP) were investigated (neurological impairment score NIS; neurological disability score NDS) in a cross-sectional design. Both groups were matched for gender and presence of pain. Quantitative sensory testing (QST), sympathetic skin response (SSR), heart rate variability (HRV), and nerve conduction studies (NCV) were performed. Both groups were compared using univariate analysis. In a stepwise discriminant analysis, discriminators between both neuropathies were identified. These discriminators were validated comparing TTR-FAP patients with a cohort of patients with chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (CIN) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP).<br /><br /><strong>Results: </strong>TTR-FAP patients scored higher in NDS and NIS and had impaired cold detection (CDT, p = .024), cold-warm discrimination (TSL, p = .019) and mechanical hyperalgesia (MPT, p = .029) at the hands, SSR (upper limb, p = .022) HRV and ulnar and sural NCS (all p < .05) were more affected in TTR-FAP.

Factors affecting overall survival (OS) were identified, and a prognostic staging system was developed.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The median age of the 360 patients diagnosed before death was 75 years (range: 47 to 94 years), and 91% were male. Presenting signs and symptoms included dyspnea or heart failure in 67% and atrial arrhythmias in 62%. Median OS from diagnosis was 3.6 years and did not change over time. Multivariate predictors of mortality included age, ejection fraction, pericardial effusion, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T. A staging system was developed that used thresholds of troponin T (0.05 ng/ml) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (3,000 pg/ml). The respective 4-year OS estimates were 57%, 42%, and 18% for stage I (both values below cutoff), stage II (one above), and stage III (both above), respectively. Stage III patients were at an increased risk of mortality after adjustment for age and sex compared with stage I patients (hazard ratio: 3.6; p < 0.001).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>The natural history of ATTRwt is poor.

However, how neuronal toxicity is generated from misfolding-prone proteins secreted by nonneuronal tissues and whether modulating protein aggregate levels at distal locales affects the degeneration of postmitotic neurons remains unknown. We generated and characterized animal models of the transthyretin (TTR) amyloidoses that faithfully recapitulate cell-nonautonomous neuronal proteotoxicity by expressing human TTR in the Caenorhabditis elegans muscle. We identified sensory neurons with affected morphological and behavioral nociception-sensing impairments. Nonnative TTR oligomer load and neurotoxicity increased following inhibition of TTR degradation in distal macrophage-like nonaffected cells. Moreover, reducing TTR levels by RNAi or by kinetically stabilizing natively folded TTR pharmacologically decreased TTR aggregate load and attenuated neuronal dysfunction.

8583371,Rare Genetic Variants of the Transthyretin Gene Are Associated with Alzheimer's Disease in Han Chinese,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the world. The neuropathological characteristics of AD patients are the accumulation of extracellular plaques of β-amyloid (Aβ) and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Transthyretin (TTR) may alleviate AD symptom by reducing Aβ concentration in the brain. There were reports for a decreased TTR level in both AD brain and blood. However, there is still no robust evidence to support the genetic association of the TTR gene with AD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential association of TTR variation with AD by directly sequencing the whole exons and the promoter region of the TTR gene in 529 AD patients and 334 healthy controls from Han Chinese population. We found no association between TTR common variants and AD but observed an enrichment of TTR rare variants in AD patients relative to controls. Further in silico prediction analysis and functional assessment at the cellular level identified four potentially pathogenic rare variants in AD patients. In particular, variant c.-239C>A could potentially downregulate the TTR promoter activity; c.200+4A>G might influence the constitutive splicing of TTR mRNA; c.148G>A (p.V50M) and c.332C>T (p.A111V) would change the structure of TTR and decrease its Aβ-binding ability.

PET utilizing 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) is the gold standard for imaging brain amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. PIB was recently shown to identify cardiac amyloidosis in both AL and ATTR amyloidosis. In the ATTR population, two types of amyloid fibrils exist, one containing fragmented and full-length TTR (type A) and the other only full-length TTR (type B). The aim of this study was to further evaluate PIB-PET in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Ten patients with biopsy-proven V30M ATTR amyloidosis and discrete or no signs of cardiac involvement were included. Patients were grouped according to TTR-fragmentation. All underwent DPD scintigraphy, echocardiography, and PIB-PET. A left ventricular PIB-retention index (PIB-RI) was established and compared to five normal volunteers.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>PIB-RI was increased in all patients (P < 0.001), but was significantly higher in type B than in type A (0.129 ± 0.041 vs 0.040 ± 0.006 min-1, P = 0.009). Cardiac DPD uptake was elevated in group A and absent in group B.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>PIB-PET, in contrast to DPD scintigraphy, has the potential to specifically identify cardiac amyloid depositions irrespective of amyloid fibril composition.

Liver transplantation has proven to be the most effective treatment for TTR-FAP. Nowadays, tafamidis is the only drug approved for TTR-FAP (early stage). However, neither liver transplantation nor tafamidis is capable to halt the progression of ocular involvement. Panretinal photocoagulation could damage the retinal pigment epithelium, and thus prevent the progression. Recent investigations on TTR-FAP and its ocular involvement are reviewed in this article.

FAP is a relentlessly progressive degenerative disease of the peripheral nervous system. However, there is a lack of mouse models to replicate the early neuropathic manifestations of FAP. METHODS: We established human TTR knock-in mice by replacing one allele of the mouse Ttr locus with human wild-type TTR (hTTRwt ) or human TTR with the A97S mutation (hTTRA97S ). Given the late onset of neuropathic manifestations in A97S-FAP, we investigated nerve pathology, physiology, and behavioural tests in these mice at two age points: the adult group (8 - 56 weeks) and the ageing group (> 104 weeks). RESULTS: In the adult group, nerve profiles, neurophysiology and behaviour were similar between hTTRwt and hTTRA97S mice. By contrast, ageing hTTRA97S mice showed small fibre neuropathy with decreased intraepidermal nerve fibre density and behavioural signs of mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, significant reductions in sural nerve myelinated nerve fibre density and sensory nerve action potential amplitudes in these mice indicated degeneration of large sensory fibres. The unaffected motor nerve physiology replicated the early symptoms of FAP patients, that is, sensory nerves were more vulnerable to mutant TTR than motor nerves.

We aim to find novel biomarkers of neurosarcoidosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by proteomic analysis, combining two-dimension electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry. We performed CSF proteomic profile of both patients (group S) and control subjects (group H). The statistical analysis of 2-D gels highlighted 42 spots significantly different between the two groups. Twenty-five spots were subjected to tryptic digestion; the peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF-TOF, giving rise to 10 identifications. Among the identified proteins, low-molecular-mass-kininogen and vitamin-D-binding-protein were increased, while transthyretin was decreased. These proteins have probably an intrathecal source and could be interesting candidates. This study led to the identification of several proteins which can be used for the diagnosis and/or monitoring of neurosarcoidosis. These putative biomarkers have to be confirmed on a larger cohort and assessed for their sensitivity and specificity.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

In this present study, we evaluated the potential of [C]-L-CMTP as a PET probe for tumor imaging.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The biodistribution of [C]-L-CMTP was determined in healthy mice and the incorporation of [C]-L-CMTP into proteins was investigated. In-vitro competitive inhibition experiments were conducted with Hepa1-6 hepatoma cell lines. [C]-L-CMTP PET imaging was performed on S180 tumor-bearing mice and lung tumor-bearing mice.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Biodistribution studies showed high uptake of [C]-L-CMTP in the liver, kidney, and pancreas, but low uptake in brain. The transport assay studies in Hepa1-6 cells suggested that [C]-L-CMTP was mainly transported by the amino acid transport system B and LAT1. [C]-L-CMTP was not incorporated into proteins in vitro. PET imaging showed that [C]-L-CMTP had high uptake in S180 fibrosarcoma tumor and lung tumor.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>[C]-L-CMTP was not incorporated into proteins and was mainly transported by the amino acid transport system B and LAT1, PET imaging showed that [C]-L-CMTP had high uptake in tumor models; it seemed to be a promising PET probe for tumor by LAT1 transport.

The AA-transporter LAT1 has been shown to be involved in [18F]-FDOPA uptake. The aim of this study was to determine whether the [18F]-FDOPA uptake was correlated with level of LAT1 expression in BT. Twenty-eight BT (including 19 gliomas and 9 metastases) were investigated by [18F]-FDOPA-PET prior to surgery and by anti-LAT1 immunohistochemistry on surgical specimens. The quantitative [18F]-FDOPA measured parameters were SUVmax, SUVmean and SUVpeak. LAT1 expression was quantified using a score (0 to 400). A significant [18F]-FDOPA uptake was associated with a LAT1 score ≥ 100 (p = 0.02) but there was no linear correlation between intensity of [18F]-FDOPA uptake and score of LAT1 expression whatever the parameters considered.

Its prognostic meaning in cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is under-investigated.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Hundred and twenty nine patients with suspected CA and an interventricular septum thickness (IVST) ≥ 12 mm underwent echocardiography with measurement of left ventricular (LV) and RV longitudinal strain (LS), late gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI, and standard evaluation.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Among 82 confirmed CA, types were immunoglobulin light chain (AL, n = 26), hereditary transthyretin (m-TTR, n = 37) and senile (WT-TTR, n = 19). Compared to those without, CA patients had significantly lower RV fractional shortening (RV-FS), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), tissue Doppler systolic velocity, and global RV-LS, without any difference among the CA types. RV-LGE, observed in 62% of CA patients, was associated with lower global and basal RV-FS. Median follow-up was 8(2; 16) months. Using multivariate analysis, NYHA-class and low TAPSE independently predicted major adverse cardiac event (MACE) defined as death, heart transplantation and acute heart failure. Independent determinants of TAPSE < 14 mm, the best cut-off value, were LV ejection fraction (LVEF), estimated filling pressure (E/E'), NT-proBNP and pulmonary artery pressure, but not RV-LGE.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>RV dysfunction is common in CA.

We explored its utility as a diagnostic tool within our population.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Patients diagnosed with AL and ATTR (wild-type and inherited) cardiac amyloidosis were prospectively recruited from the Princess Alexandra Hospital Amyloidosis Centre. Patients underwent injection with 99mTc-DPD then planar whole body imaging was performed at 5 minutes post-injection (soft tissue phase) and 3 hours (bone phase). A myocardial SPECT and low amperage CT were acquired after the late whole-body scan. Scans were analysed by two nuclear imaging specialists. Intensity of cardiac 99mTc-DPD uptake was graded as 0 to 3 in accordance with previous criteria, and semiquantitative analysis was performed using a heart to whole body ratio (H:WB) on the 3-hour scan. Patients also underwent electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography, and blood samples were taken for troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide levels, to assess for any correlation with DPD uptake.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Twenty-one patients (8 AL and 13 ATTR) completed the study. Median age was 58 and 70 years for AL and ATTR patients respectively, and 19 (90.5%) were male. 99mTc-DPD scintigraphy was positive in 2 (25%) of AL, and 13 (100%) of ATTR patients. Grade of cardiac uptake, and mean H:WB (0.1249 v. 0.0794) was greater in the ATTR cohort (p-value<0.001 and 0.001 respectively). No statistically significant correlation was identified between H:WB and echocardiographic parameters.

After 6 years a cardiac biopsy was conducted because of changes in the electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram results, revealing amyloid deposition. Additional genetic studies revealed no TTR gene mutations, leading to a definitive diagnosis of wild-type transthyretin-related amyloidosis (ATTR). The patient started taking diflunisal as a stabilizer which is one of the advanced therapies for ATTR, and then the heart failure symptoms and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level improved in short-term follow-up. We present an elderly patient with ATTR, which is believed to be rare.

Data on cardiac biomarkers in transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) are lacking.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>Patients (n = 1617) with any of the following cardiac biomarkers, BNP (n = 1079), NT-proBNP (n = 550), troponin T (n = 274), and troponin I (n = 108), available at baseline in the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS) were analyzed for differences between genotypes and phenotypes and their association with survival. Median level of BNP was 68.0 pg/mL (IQR 30.5-194.9), NT-proBNP 337.9 pg/mL (IQR 73.0-2584.0), troponin T 0.03 μg/L (IQR 0.01-0.05), and troponin I 0.08 μg/L (IQR 0.04-0.13). NT-proBNP and BNP were higher in wild-type than mutant-type ATTR, troponin T and I did not differ, respectively. Non-Val30Met patients had higher BNP, NT-proBNP and troponin T levels than Val30Met patients, but not troponin I. Late-onset Val30Met was associated with higher levels of troponin I and troponin T compared with early-onset. 115 patients died during a median follow-up of 1.2 years. Mortality increased with increasing quartiles (BNP/NT-proBNP Q1 = 1.7%, Q2 = 5.2%, Q3 = 21.7%, Q4 = 71.3%; troponin T/I Q1 = 6.5%, Q2 = 14.5%, Q3 = 33.9%, Q4 = 45.2%). Three-year overall-survival estimates for BNP/NT-proBNP and troponin T/I quartiles differed significantly (p<0.001). Stepwise risk stratification was achieved by combining NT-proBNP/BNP and troponin T/I. From Cox proportional hazards model, age, modified body mass index, mutation (Val30Met vs. Non-Val30Met) and BNP/NT-proBNP (Q1-Q3 pooled vs. Q4) were identified as independent predictors of survival in patients with mutant-type ATTR.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>In this ATTR patient cohort, cardiac biomarkers were abnormal in a substantial percentage of patients irrespective of genotype. Along with age, mBMI, and mutation (Val30Met vs. Non-Val30Met), cardiac biomarkers were associated with surrogates of disease severity with BNP/NT-proBNP identified as an independent predictor of survival in ATTR.<br /><br /><strong>TRIAL REGISTRATION: </strong>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00628745.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Cells were subsequently cultured at 33 degrees C to activate large T-antigen. At the third passage, cells were cloned by colony formation and isolated from other cells using a penicillin cup.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Five immortalized cell lines of choroid plexus epithelial cells (TR-CSFB 1 approximately 5) were obtained from two Tg rats. These cell lines had a polygonal cell morphology, expressed the typical choroid plexus epithelial cell marker, transthyretin, and possessed Na+, K+-ATPase on their apical side. TR-CSFBs cells expressed a large T-antigen and grew well at 33 degrees C with a doubling-time of 35 approximately 40 hr. [3H]-L-Proline uptake by TR-CSFB cells took place in an Na+-dependent, ouabain-sensitive, energy-dependent, and concentration-dependent manner. It was also inhibited by alpha-methylaminoisobutylic acid, suggesting that system A for amino acids operates in TR-CSFB cells. When [3H]-L-proline uptake was measured using the Transwell device, the L-proline uptake rate following application to the apical side was five-fold greater than that following application to the basal side. In addition, both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent L-glutamic acid (L-Glu) uptake processes were present in TR-CSFB cells.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Immortalized choroid plexus epithelial cell lines were successfully established from Tg rats and have the properties of choroid plexus epithelial cells, and amino acid transport activity was observed in vivo.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Deposition of amyloid in extracerebral tissues is very common and seems inevitable for an aging person. Most deposits are localized, small, and probably without consequence, but in some instances, they are associated with diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Other extracerebral amyloidoses are systemic, with life-threatening effects on the heart, kidneys, and other organs. Here, we review how amyloid may spread through seeding and whether transmission of amyloid diseases may occur between humans.

8583497,Modulation of LAT1 (SLC7A5) transporter activity and stability by membrane cholesterol,"LAT1 (SLC7A5) is a transporter for both the uptake of large neutral amino acids and a number of pharmaceutical drugs. It is expressed in numerous cell types including T-cells, cancer cells and brain endothelial cells. However, mechanistic knowledge of how it functions and its interactions with lipids are unknown or limited due to inability of obtaining stable purified protein in sufficient quantities. Our data show that depleting cellular cholesterol reduced the Vmax but not the Km of the LAT1 mediated uptake of a model substrate into cells (L-DOPA). A soluble cholesterol analogue was required for the stable purification of the LAT1 with its chaperon CD98 (4F2hc,SLC3A2) and that this stabilised complex retained the ability to interact with a substrate. We propose cholesterol interacts with the conserved regions in the LAT1 transporter that have been shown to bind to cholesterol/CHS in Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter. In conclusion, LAT1 is modulated by cholesterol impacting on its stability and transporter activity.

The function of Lat1 at the BBB was evaluated in wildtype mice with and without LPS-induced neuroinflammation and APP/PS1 transgenic mice by in situ brain perfusion.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>There were 2.1 and 1.6 -fold decreases in Lat1 mRNA and protein expression in LPS-treated wildtype astrocytes compared to vehicle-treated astrocytes. In contrast, Lat1 mRNA and protein expression were increased by 1.7 and 1.2 -fold (not statistically significant) in the transgenic cells. A similar trend was observed in the cell uptake of [14C]-L-leucine. There were no statistically significant differences in [14C]-L-leucine BBB permeation between the groups.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>The results showed that neither LPS-induced inflammation or the presence of APP/PS1 mutations alters Lat1 function at the mouse BBB as well as Lat1 protein expression and function in mouse primary astrocytes.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

To assess the stereospecificity and evaluate the influence of aromatic ring modification of phenylalanine LAT1 targeting tracers, six different fluoroalkylated phenylalanine analogues were synthesized.

Thus, early diagnosis and prevention of AD are crucial. The present study focused on comparing the plasma protein changes between patients with AD and their healthy counterparts, aiming to explore a specific protein panel as a potential biomarker for AD patients in Han Chinese. Hence, we recruited and collected plasma samples from 98 AD patients and 101 elderly healthy controls from Wuxi and Shanghai Mental Health Centers.

The incidence of amyloid deposition increased with age. The number of organs affected with amyloid deposition in each case also increased with age. The incidence of amyloid deposition in each organ was as follows; 88% in pituitary gland, 66% in brain [amyloid of senile plaque (SP) (61%) and/or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (56%)], 33% in pancreas, 3% in heart, and less in others. In immunohistochemical studies using the antisera to the various kinds of amyloid or related proteins, amyloid beta protein was demonstrated in brain amyloids including SP and CAA, but not in others. Cardiac amyloid was positive for prealbumin. Pituitary amyloid and CAA were positive for amyloid P-component. The incidence of brain amyloids in DAT were significantly higher than that in non-DAT. There was no significant difference in the incidence of pituitary and pancreatic amyloid between DAT and non-DAT. In the non-DAT patients, there were significant positive correlations in amyloid deposition between the brain and pituitary gland and between the brain and pancreas.

8583160,Immunohistochemical identification of some plasma proteins in human embryonic and fetal forebrain with particular reference to the development of the neocortex,"The histogenesis of the cerebral neocortex has been studied in human embryos and fetuses from the ventricular zone stage at 9-10 mm crown-rump length (CRL) to the well-developed neocortex at 210 mm CRL. The initial proliferation of the neuroepithelial cells in the ventricular zone stage was followed by a stage characterized by a ventricular zone covered by a primordial plexiform layer; the subventricular zone then arose before the cortical plate was formed within the primordial plexiform layer, thus dividing it into an outer marginal zone and an inner subplate zone; finally the intermediate zone appeared between the subventricular and subplate zones. The distribution of cells containing albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, transferrin, prealbumin, IgG and alpha 1-antitrypsin in the cerebral vesicle and developing neocortex was investigated by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Alpha-fetoprotein found in the cells of the ventricular zone was the most widespread and prominent of the plasma proteins examined in the early embryos. The cerebral vesicle was negative for all other plasma proteins investigated at this stage. By 15 and 16 mm CRL, a few cells in the ventricular zone were positive for albumin and transferrin whereas AFP exhibited a distribution similar to that of the 9 mm embryo. By 20-25 mm CRL, albumin and AFP had a similar distribution in the telencephalic wall. At 40-150 mm CRL a positive staining reaction for AFP, albumin, prealbumin and transferrin was predominant in the outer half of cortical plate. At 150-170 mm CRL only cells in the inner half exhibited positive staining and at 210 mm CRL the staining reactions were negative. The cells containing plasma proteins did not belong to a single cell line or type; thus plasma proteins were detected primarily in different types of neurons but also in glial cells. Staining with polyvalent antiserum indicated that the same cells may be positive for more than one plasma protein. Positive staining reactions were also observed in or along fiber systems. It is proposed that cells initially take up plasma protein from the CSF and migrate with it towards the cortical plate. After a certain period they lose their plasma protein but when the neuronal cells which represent the majority of the positively stained cells have reached their final position in the cortical plate they commence plasma protein synthesis which continues for a short period during which the neurons establish their pattern of connectivity.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The total protein concentration and the relative concentration of each protein fraction were calculated for each day. The main proteins found along development were immunoglobulin G, transferrin, alpha-fetoprotein, serum albumin, ovalbumin, prealbumin, and an unidentified component. alpha-Fetoprotein was found to be the major protein at 4-16 days, and serum albumin at 17-19 days of development.

In eight of 13 of the dementia cases strongly immunostained deposits of plasma proteins were observed around numerous capillaries of layers I-IV of frontal grey matter. Each of these deposits contained albumin, prealbumin, IgG, C1q, C3c, and fibrinogen. No such deposits were found in any of the seven non-demented aged controls. In contrast, in white matter in both demented and normal aged control cases only weak immunostaining of serum proteins was observed which gradually decreased with the distance from the vessels. The presence of heavy deposits of serum proteins exclusively around the capillaries of the gray matter in cases with vascular dementia may indicate a defect of the cortical capillary system which might play a role in the clinical symptoms seen in vascular dementia. The enrichment of C1q within the deposits is intriguing as this might occur because of the binding of C1 through its subunit C1q to the antibody-antigen complex and thereby support a possible immunologic involvement in the formation of these deposits.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Forty-five CSF samples were obtained by repeat lumbar punctures at various intervals, from four autopsy-proven cases and three male and nine female patients with clinically definite MS. When total protein content was increased, the percentages of prealbumin and tau fraction were decreased significantly in association with the presence of haptoglobin (Hp) polymers in nearly all the samples, as a result of increased permeability of the BCB. Even when the total protein content was normal, Hp polymers were detected in 56% of the samples, and the tau fraction tended to be decreased. Monoclonal immunoglobulin and Hp polymers were both recognized in some cases. The results suggested a more frequent occurrence of BCB impairment in MS than had formerly been revealed by CSF albumin analysis, and accorded with the recent reports of contrast-enhancing lesions of MS brain in computerized tomography.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

A regional distribution of plasma proteins in human embryonic brain, spinal cord and some neural crest derivates is shown in this study. Alphafetoprotein was the most widespread and prominent of the plasma proteins examined in early embryos. It was observed intracellularly in the ventricular zone of the fore-, mid- and hindbrain whereas other CNS regions and neural crest derivates were negative in the earliest 9 mm crown rump length (CRL) embryo examined. The embryonic nervous system was markedly negative for all other plasma proteins tested at this stage. By 15 and 16 mm CRL, a few cells in the ventricular zone and in sensory cranial nerve ganglia were positive for albumin and transferrin whereas AFP exhibited a distribution similar to that of the 9 mm embryo. By 20 to 35 mm CRI, albumin and AFP had the same extensive distribution in the CNS. Many cells in sensory and autonomic ganglia showed positive staining for albumin in contrast to a few scattered cells which exhibited reactivity for AFP, transferrin and prealbumin. The staining pattern for albumin in the ganglia may reflect a rostral-caudal gradient in development.

8583179,Localization of human prealbumin in choroid plexus epithelium,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is generally considered to be derived from plasma through a combined process of ultrafiltration and secretion by the choroid plexus. However, the mechanisms ultimately responsible for achieving the final protein composition of CSF are uncertain. Some proteins, in particular prealbumin, are present in quantities not easily explained by usual physicochemical considerations. To investigate the possibility of de novo synthesis by choroid epithelium, we have examined human choroid plexus an ependyma for the presence of prealbumin. Using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method at the light and electron microscopic level, as well as immunofluorescence, we localized prealbumin in choroid epithelial cytoplasm on the endoplasmic reticulum and in association with the Golgi apparatus. Ependymal cells and stroma did not reveal immunocytochemical labeling.

The measured concentrations of prealbumin in the CSF indicate that there are two sources of prealbumin: a minor fraction enters the CSF via the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (B-CSF) barrier like albumin, and the major fraction enters the CSF at the ventricles, probably during production of the CSF in the ventricles. The two fractions can be calculated from the CSF concentration of prealbumin, serum prealbumin and the concentration gradient (serum/CSF) of albumin.

8583115,Demonstration of transthyretin mRNA in the brain and other extrahepatic tissues in the rat,"Studies were conducted to ascertain if transthyretin mRNA was present in extrahepatic tissues of the rat. A trnasthyretin cDNA clone was isolated from a lambda gt11 human liver cDNA library by antibody screening and its identity was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. This transthyretin cDNA clone was used to survey poly(A+) RNA isolated from 12 different rat tissues for transthyretin mRNA by Northern blot analysis. The liver contained the highest level of transthyretin mRNA and this level was not altered by the vitamin A status of the rat. A significant amount of transthyretin mRNA was found in the brain (30% of the level of the liver) which was localized in specific regions of the brain. In addition, detectable levels of transthyretin mRNA (1% to 2% of that of the liver) were observed in the stomach, heart, skeletal muscle, and spleen. Translation of brain poly(A+) RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and immunoprecipitation of the translation products with anti-transthyretin antiserum resulted in a protein band of the same size as liver pre-transthyretin. Liver pre-transthyretin was processed by the cotranslational addition of dog pancreas microsomal membranes to a protein that migrated coincidentally with monomeric serum transthyretin. These data suggest that transthyretin in the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid results from de novo synthesis and that transthyretin may play a significant physiological function, as yet unknown, within the nervous system.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The protein is marked as BTB-protein, as it migrates under disc electrophoresis in 7,5% polyacrylamide gel with the ""witness"" front of bromothemol blue (BTB). The content of BTB-protein is 0.06--0.08 gr per 100 gr of wet tissue. The protein is RNA-proteid. Its molecular weight is 10,000--20,000. BTB-protein contains 42 mole % of acidic amino acids and 5.4 mole % of alkaline ones. The protein was found in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. It is mainly an all-organs protein. Small amount of this protein is found in blood serum. BTB-protein can be found on the disc electrophoregramms of embryo and newborn rats brain proteins, as well as of the brain of other mammals, birds and amphibia.

It was found that the immunoglobulins, with some exceptions, were fractionated in the G-zone which was defined as an area between the origin and 0.57 in terms of relative migration based on transferrin (RT). Fourty-four percent of the whole Bence Jones protein bands which were examined were detected in the area of RT 0.70-0.90.

B2-zone, 7.94+/-1.93%; G-zone, 16.05+/-2.49%. The following significant results were obtained: (1) When the total protein concentration (TP) of CSF is increased: the percentage of the Pre-alb-zone is lowered and that of the A1- and G-zones is increased in diseases such as neurosyphilis, infectious meningitis, brain tumour, multiple sclerosis, intervertebral disc protrusion and cerebral infarction. The A2-zone was diminished in cerebral infarction, and a similar change was seen in brain tumour with in addition a decrease of the B2-zone; (2) When the TP was normal: the percentage of the G-zone was increased in multiple sclerosis, brain tumour and intervertebral disc protrusion.

Control antisera were tested against amyloid fibril proteins of the AA- (serum amyloid A-derived), A lambda-, and A kappa-(immunoglobulin light chain-derived)amyloid types. Senile cardiac amyloid was specifically identified in tissue sections with antisera against ASc1, AF, and PA, but not with anti-AA, -A lambda, and -A kappa, thus showing cross-reactivity of ASc1 and AF with each other and with PA, but antigenic differences to the other amyloid types. Likewise, amyloid in AF syndromes, including the Japanese, the German, and the Portuguese types, were stained with anti-AF, anti-ASc1, and anti-PA, but not with the antisera against AA, A lambda, A kappa, again showing common antigenic determinants of AF and ASc1 and PA.

8583316,Serum levels of proteins involved in amyloid-β clearance are related to cognitive decline and neuroimaging changes in mild cognitive impairment,"<strong>Introduction: </strong>Amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance is important for damage prevention in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the utility of Aβ clearance proteins as biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI).<br /><br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Serum apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, compliment protein C3 (C3), transthyretin, and cholesterol levels were measured in 273 subjects, and we analyzed the relationship between these levels and brain atrophy and cerebral blood flow in 63 clinically diagnosed mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and nondemented disease control subjects.<br /><br /><strong>Results: </strong>ApoA-I and transthyretin levels and the active form of C3:native form of C3 ratio achieved an area under the curve of 0.89 (sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 90%) for detecting late mild cognitive impairment. Atrophy was associated with decreased apoA-I and high-density lipoprotein levels. Subjects with reduced cerebral blood flow had lower levels of active form of C3, apoA-I, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol. Low native form of C3 and high active form of C3 levels were found in the hippocampi of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br /><strong>Discussion: </strong>Aβ clearance proteins in the serum are potential biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment evaluation.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8583318,Molecular characteristics supporting L-Type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1)-mediated translocation,"l-Type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is an interesting protein due to its peculiar expression profile. It can be utilized not only as a carrier for improved or targeted drug delivery, e.g., into the brain but also as a target protein by which amino acid supply can be restricted, e.g., from the cancer cells. The recognition and binding processes of LAT1-ligands, such as amino acids and clinically used small molecules, including l-dopa, gabapentin, and melphalan, are today well-known. Binding to LAT1 is crucial, particularly when designing the LAT1-inhibitors. However, it will not guarantee effective translocation across the cell membrane via LAT1, which is a definite requirement for LAT1-substrates, such as drugs that elicit their pharmacological effects inside the cells. Therefore, in the present study, the accumulation of known LAT1-utilizing compounds into the selected LAT1-expressing cancer cells (MCF-7) was explored experimentally over a time period. The differences found among the transport efficiency and affinity of the studied compounds for LAT1 were subsequently explained by docking the ligands into the human LAT1 model (based on the recent cryo-electron microscopy structure). Thus, the findings of this study clarify the favorable structural requirements of the size, shape, and polarity of the ligands that support the translocation and effective transport across the cell membrane via LAT1. This knowledge can be applied in future drug design to attain improved or targeted drug delivery and hence, successful LAT1-utilizing drugs with increased therapeutic effects.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8583322,Improved l-Type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1)-mediated delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs into astrocytes and microglia with reduced prostaglandin production,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can have protective effects in the brain by inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX). However, the delivery into the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and particularly into the brain parenchymal cells is hindered. Therefore, in the present study, we developed four l-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1)-utilizing prodrugs of flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen, since LAT1 is expressed on both, the BBB endothelial cells as well as parenchymal cells. The cellular uptake and utilization of LAT1 by novel prodrugs were studied in mouse cortical primary astrocytes and immortalized microglia (BV2), and the release of the parent NSAID in several tissue and cell homogenates. Finally, the effects of the studied prodrugs on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and cell viability were explored. The gained results showed that all four prodrugs were carried into their target cells via LAT1. They also released their parent NSAIDs via carboxylesterases (CES) and most likely also other un-identified enzymes, which need to be carefully considered when administrating these compounds orally or intravenously. Most importantly, all the studied prodrugs reduced the PGE2 production in astrocytes and microglia after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation by 29-94% and without affecting the cell viability with the studied concentration (20 µM).",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

8584548,Unifying features of systemic and cerebral amyloidosis,"Amyloidosis is a generic term for a group of clinically and biochemically diverse diseases that are characterized by the deposition of an insoluble fibrillar protein in the extracellular space. Over 16 biochemically distinct amyloids are known. Despite this diversity, all amyloids have a particular ultrastructural and tinctorial appearance, a beta-pleated sheet structure, and are codeposited with a group of amyloid-associated proteins. The most common amyloidosis is Alzheimer's disease (AD), where A beta is the main component of the amyloid. Recently it has been found that A beta exists as a normal soluble protein (sA beta) in biological fluids. This links AD more closely to some of the systemic amyloidoses, where the amyloid precursor is found in the circulation normally. Numerous mutations have been found in the A beta precursor (beta PP) gene, associated with familial AD. Many mutations are also found in some of the hereditary systemic amyloidoses. For example, over 40 mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene are associated with amyloid. However, both A beta and TTR related amyloid deposition can occur with no mutation. The pathogenesis of amyloid is complex, and appears to be associated with genetic and environmental risk factors that can be similar in the systemic and cerebral amyloidoses.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584619,Dynamics of brain-derived proteins in cerebrospinal fluid,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>The recent theory of blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier function and dysfunction connects molecular flux and CSF flow rate. A reduced CSF flow rate is sufficient to account for the observed hyperbolic relation between different blood-derived protein concentrations in CSF in cases of a blood-CSF barrier dysfunction.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The dynamics of brain-derived proteins in CSF are investigated with reference to the CSF flow rate measured by CSF/serum albumin concentration quotient.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Proteins from neurons or glial cells, tau protein, neuron-specific enolase, S-100 protein, all enter CSF primarily in the ventricular and cisternal space. Their concentration between normal ventricular and lumbar CSF is decreasing (in contrast to blood-derived proteins), and in the case of pathologically decreasing CSF flow rate, the concentration in lumbar CSF remains invariantly constant. Concentrations of the primarily leptomeningeal proteins, beta-trace protein and cystatin C, increase between normal ventricular and lumbar CSF, and in the case of pathologically decreased CSF flow rate they increase linearly in lumbar CSF (concentrations of blood-derived proteins increase non-linearly).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>A satisfactory physiological explanation can now be given for the dynamics of proteins in CSF consisting of both brain- and blood-derived fractions (transthyretin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (s-ICAM)), as well as the disputed decrease of leptomeningeal protein concentrations (beta-trace protein, cystatin C) in cases of bacterial meningitis is also explained. The biophysical treatment of dynamics in the ventricular and lumbar CSF extends the new theory and shows that CSF flow rate is the most relevant parameter for understanding the pathological changes of both blood- and brain-derived proteins in CSF.

We found four definitely and three probably affected members in this family of 56 persons in four generations. Clinical features in all definitely diseased patients include disturbance of memory, psychomotor deceleration, ataxia, and hearing loss. In most patients there was temporary disorientation, migraine-like headache with vomiting, and tremor. Some patients had nystagmus, pyramidal signs with spastic paraparesis, hallucinations, urinary retention, and obstipation. Single patients had facial tics and sleep disorders. Progressive visual disturbance and clinically manifest polyneuropathy were absent. CSF protein was markedly elevated in all patients. CT showed characteristic symmetric calcification along the sylvian fissure; MRI after contrast administration showed prominent enhancement at the surface of the sylvian fissures, brainstem, and cerebellum. Autopsy data was available in three definitely affected patients and in one unaffected family member. Immunohistochemistry identified the amyloid deposits as of the AF (transthyretin, TTR) type; DNA studies revealed a novel TTR missense mutation at codon 18 (TTR Asp18Gly). According to clinical features, pathologic alterations, and molecular studies, this disease is a novel type of systemic familial amyloidosis with disease manifestation clinically restricted to the CNS.

Diagnoses of the first operations were choroid plexus papilloma (PP; 32 cases), choroid plexus papilloma with histological atypies (atypical PP; 6 cases), and choroid plexus carcinoma (PC; 14 cases). Carcinoembryonic antigen was expressed by 2 of the 3 biopsies autoptically recognized as metastatic carcinomas and by 2 autopsy cases of PC, while it was absent in all biopsies of true choroid plexus tumors. Tumor cells positive for transthyretin (TTR, prealbumin), S-100 protein (S100), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were detected in 39, 46 and 13, respectively, of the 49 cases of true choroid plexus tumors. Fourth ventricle tumors expressed more S100 (number of positive tumor cells) than lateral ventricle tumors, PP more S100 and TTR than atypical PP/PC. Tumors from patients 20 years of age and older expressed more GFAP and TTR than tumors from younger patients. Of the 30 patients with complete follow-up 19 were alive 2 to 11 years after surgery, including 7 recurrencies. Eleven died from the tumor 4 months to 7 years after surgery. The following histopathologic features (in order of decreasing significance) were correlated with poor prognosis (recurrency or fatal outcome): less than 50% of the tumor cells heavily positive for S100, presence of mitoses, absence of TTR-positive cells, brain invasion by cell nests, absence of marked stromal edema, and presence of necrotic areas.

Immunohistochemical evaluation utilized antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100 protein, prealbumin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). GFAP-positive cells were detected in 1 Rathke's cleft cyst and in 1 choroidal epithelial cyst. S-100-positive cells were detected in 2 Rathke's cleft cysts, in 2 neurenteric cysts, in 1 colloid cyst, and in 2 choroidal epithelial cysts. Prealbumin-positive cells were detected only in the 2 choroidal epithelial cysts. CEA-positive cells were detected in 1 Rathke's cleft cyst and in 2 neurenteric cysts. EMA-positive cells were detected in all cases. Immunohistochemical study of prealbumin and S-100 protein is useful for correct diagnosis of choroidal epithelial cyst and study of CEA is useful for diagnosis of neurenteric cyst. The arachnoid cyst is negative for immunoreactivity to GFAP, S-100, prealbumin, and CEA; this can be helpful in distinguishing this type of cyst from single epithelial cysts, a task that is sometimes difficult with only light microscopy.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

8632176,A thyroid hormone network exists in synovial fibroblasts of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients,"While patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) sometimes demonstrate thyroidal illness, the role of thyroid hormones in inflamed synovial tissue is unknown. This is relevant because thyroid hormones stimulate immunity, and local cells can regulate thyroid hormone levels by deiodinases (DIO). The study followed the hypothesis that elements of a thyroid hormone network exist in synovial tissue. In 12 patients with RA and 32 with osteoarthritis (OA), we used serum, synovial fluid, synovial tissue, and synovial fibroblasts (SF) in order to characterize the local thyroid hormone network using ELISAs, immunohistochemistry, imaging methods, tissue superfusion studies, cell-based ELISAs, flow cytometry, and whole genome expression profiling. Serum/synovial fluid thyroid hormone levels were similar in RA and OA (inclusion criteria: no thyroidal illness). The degradation product termed reverse triiodothyronine (reverse T3) was much lower in serum compared to synovial fluid indicating biodegradation of thyroid hormones in the synovia I environment. Superfusion experiments with synovial tissue also demonstrated biodegradation, particularly in RA. Cellular membrane transporters of thyroid hormones, DIOs, and thyroid hormone receptors were present in tissue and SF. Density of cells positive for degrading DIOs were higher in RA than OA. TNF increased protein expression of degrading DIOs in RASF and OASF. Gene expression studies of RASF revealed insignificant gene regulation by bioactive T3. RA and OA synovial tissue/SF show a local thyroid hormone network. Thyroid hormones undergo strong biodegradation in synovium.

The 7.6-kilobase (kb) human transthyretin gene containing about 500 base pairs (bp) in the upstream region was used for microinjection. Seven out of nine transgenic mice had detectable amounts of human transthyretin in serum when analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Transthyretin mRNA was detected in liver and yolk sac but not in other tissues including brain. The amount of mRNA was variable among transgenic mice and was about one-tenth of mouse endogenous transthyretin mRNA. Human and mouse transthyretin mRNAs were detected in liver of fetus and yolk sac at 13 days of gestation and unlike yolk sac the level of mRNA in liver increased gradually during development and reached the maximum at around 17 days of gestation.

We characterized T(1)AM transport and conversion in an in vitro culture of H9c2 murine cells, after a T(1)AM bolus injection. Samples of cell medium culture and cell lysate were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. We performed comparative experiments by adding to T(1)AM bolus amino oxidase inhibitors as iproniazid, pargyline (monoamine oxidase, MAO inhibitors), aminoguanidine, and semicarbazide (semicarbazide-sensitive amino oxidase, SSAO inhibitors). A mathematical model was developed, based on the assumption that T(1)AM is transported with a mechanism that is typical of hormone transport (i.e., EGF or insulin). We noticed that surface receptors downregulation could play a major role in T(1)AM dynamics. We also estimated that T(1)AM catabolism is mainly affected by MAO inhibitors, which produce a dramatic decrease in the kinetic constants related to T(1)AM degradation, while no significant changes were observed in experiments with SSAO inhibitors.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Design: T(1)AM, total T-3, and total T-4 were assayed in serum by a novel HPLC tandem mass spectrometry assay, which has already been validated in animal investigations, and the results were related to standard clinical and laboratory variables. Setting and Patients: The series included one healthy volunteer, 24 patients admitted to a cardiological ward, and 17 ambulatory patients suspected of thyroid disease, who underwent blood sampling at admission for routine diagnostic purposes. Seven patients were affected by type 2 diabetes, and six patients showed echocardiographic evidence of impaired left ventricular function. Interventions: No intervention or any patient selection was performed. Main Outcome Measures: serum T(1)AM, total and free T-3 and T-4, routine chemistry, routine hematology, and echocardiographic parameters were measured. Results: T(1)AM was detected in all samples, and its concentration averaged 0.219 +/- 0.012 pmol/ml. The T(1)AM concentration was significantly correlated to total T-4 (r = 0.654, P < 0.001), total T-3 (r = 0.705, P < 0.001), glycated hemoglobin (r = 0.508, P = 0.013), brain natriuretic peptide (r = 0.543, P = 0.016), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (r = 0.675, P < 0.001). In diabetic vs. nondiabetic patients T(1)AM concentration was significantly increased (0.232 +/- 0.014 vs. 0.203 +/- 0.006 pmol/ml, P = 0.044), whereas no significant difference was observed in patients with cardiac dysfunction. Conclusions: T(1)AM is an endogenous messenger that can be assayed in human blood. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that circulating T(1)AM is produced from thyroid hormones and encourage further investigations on the potential role of T(1)AM in insulin resistance and heart failure.

8627706,Delivery of Thyronamines (TAMs) to the Brain: A Preliminary Study,"Recent reports highlighted the significant neuroprotective effects of thyronamines (TAMs), a class of endogenous thyroid hormone derivatives. In particular, 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) has been shown to play a pleiotropic role in neurodegeneration by modulating energy metabolism and neurological functions in mice. However, the pharmacological response to T1AM might be influenced by tissue metabolism, which is known to convert T1AM into its catabolite 3-iodothyroacetic acid (TA1). Currently, several research groups are investigating the pharmacological effects of T1AM systemic administration in the search of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of interlinked pathologies, such as metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). A critical aspect in the development of new drugs for NDDs is to know their distribution in the brain, which is fundamentally related to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To this end, in the present study we used the immortalized mouse brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 to develop an in vitro model of BBB and evaluate T1AM and TA1 permeability. Both drugs, administered at 1 µM dose, were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Our results indicate that T1AM is able to efficiently cross the BBB, whereas TA1 is almost completely devoid of this property.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
8627708,3-Monoiodothyronamine: The rationale for its action as an endogenous adrenergic-blocking neuromodulator,"The investigations reported here were designed to gain insights into the role of 3-monoiodothyronamine (T1AM) in the brain, where the amine was originally identified and characterized. Extensive deiodinase studies indicated that T1AM was derived from the T4 metabolite, reverse triiodothyronine (revT3), while functional studies provided well-confirmed evidence that T1AM has strong adrenergic-blocking effects. Because a state of adrenergic overactivity prevails when triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations become excessive, the possibility that T3's metabolic partner, revT3, might give rise to an antagonist of those T3 actions was thought to be reasonable. All T1AM studies thus far have required use of pharmacological doses. Therefore we considered that choosing a physiological site of action was a priority and focused on the locus coeruleus (LC), the major noradrenergic control center in the brain. Site-directed injections of T1AM into the LC elicited a significant, dose-dependent neuronal firing rate change in a subset of adrenergic neurons with an EC50=2.7 mu M, a dose well within the physiological range. Further evidence for its physiological actions came from autoradiographic images obtained following intravenous carrier-free I-125-labeled T1AM injection. These showed that the amine bound with high affinity to the LC and to other selected brain nuclei, each of which is both an LC target and a known T3 binding site. This new evidence points to a physiological role for T1AM as an endogenous adrenergic-blocking neuromodulator in the central noradrenergic system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

8632173,Cardiac effects of thyronamines,"3-Iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) is an endogenous compound derived from thyroid hormone through decarboxylation and deiodination, which interacts with a novel G protein-coupled receptor, known as trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). TAAR1 and other receptors of this family are expressed in several tissues, including the heart. Functional effects have been observed after administration of exogenous T(1)AM: in the isolated heart, a negative inotropic and chronotropic action was produced, and the resistance to ischemic injury was increased, possibly as a consequence of an action on intracellular calcium homeostasis. Extracardiac effects include reduction of body temperature, increased lipid versus carbohydrate metabolism, and modulation of insulin secretion. T(1)AM might play an important physiological or pathophysiological role, and this signaling system might allow the development of new therapeutical agents.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8632172,New insights into the role of thyroid hormone in cardiac remodeling: time to reconsider?,"Chronic ischemia or pressure overload decreases thyroid hormone (TH) signaling and activates the fetal gene program in the heart. While these features are of physiologic importance in the developing heart, their respective roles in the postnatal heart are debated. Administration of TH can prevent the changes of the fetal gene program and rebuild the heart after an ""index event"" such as ischemia. TH affects cardiac remodeling by limiting reperfusion injury, and, at later states, by inducing distinct changes in cardiac chamber geometry in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, administration of TH can convert pathologic to physiologic hypertrophy. These effects are the result of favorable cellular remodeling. While preliminary clinical studies provide encouraging results, the potential and efficacy of TH in the treatment of heart disease still await evaluation in large clinical trials.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8632171,TAAR Agonists,"Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. The first discovered TAAR1 is mainly expressed in the brain, and is able to detect low abundant trace amines. TAAR1 is also activated by several synthetic compounds and psychostimulant drugs like amphetamine. Activation of TAAR1 by specific agonists can regulate the classical monoaminergic systems in the brain. Further studies have revealed that other TAAR family members are highly expressed in the olfactory system which are termed olfactory TAARs. In vertebrates, olfactory TAARs can specifically recognize volatile or water-soluble amines. Some of these TAAR agonists are produced by decarboxylation of amino acids. In addition, some TAAR agonists are ethological odors that mediate animal innate behaviors.

Therefore, efforts have been made to develop chemical treatments against the parasite. In the past, synthetic products were preferentially used to combat Varroa mites. Nowadays, mainly plant essential oils and organic acids are applied because they are safer and impose less unfavorable effects on the environment. Essential oils contain mixtures of mostly volatile and odorous terpenoid constituents. The molecular targets of these substances are tyramine and/or octopamine receptors that control and modulate vital functions ranging from metabolism to behavior. Disturbing the native function of these receptors in the mite results in deleterious effects in this parasite. This overview considers not only tyramine and octopamine receptors but also other potential targets of essential oils including ionotropic GABA(A) receptors, TRP type ion channels, and acetylcholinesterase.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Metabolic rate reduction in natural torpor is linked to profound changes in biochemical processes, i.e., shift from glycolysis to lipolysis and ketone utilization, intensive but reversible alterations in organs like the brain and kidney, and in heart rate control via Ca2+. This state would prevent degenerative processes due to organ disuse and increase resistance against radiation defects.

8632167,Insights into Enzyme Catalysis and Thyroid Hormone Regulation of Cerebral Ketimine Reductase/mu-Crystallin Under Physiological Conditions,"Mammalian ketimine reductase is identical to mu-crystallin (CRYM)-a protein that is also an important thyroid hormone binding protein. This dual functionality implies a role for thyroid hormones in ketimine reductase regulation and also a reciprocal role for enzyme catalysis in thyroid hormone bioavailability. In this research we demonstrate potent sub-nanomolar inhibition of enzyme catalysis at neutral pH by the thyroid hormones l-thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, whereas other thyroid hormone analogues were shown to be far weaker inhibitors. We also investigated (a) enzyme inhibition by the substrate analogues pyrrole-2-carboxylate, 4,5-dibromopyrrole-2-carboxylate and picolinate, and (b) enzyme catalysis at neutral pH of the cyclic ketimines S-(2-aminoethyl)-l-cysteine ketimine (owing to the complex nomenclature trivial names are used for the sulfur-containing cyclic ketimines as per the original authors' descriptions) (AECK), Delta(1)-piperideine-2-carboxylate (P2C), Delta(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate (Pyr2C) and Delta(2)-thiazoline-2-carboxylate. Kinetic data obtained at neutral pH suggests that ketimine reductase/CRYM plays a major role as a P2C/Pyr2C reductase and that AECK is not a major substrate at this pH. Thus, ketimine reductase is a key enzyme in the pipecolate pathway, which is the main lysine degradation pathway in the brain. In silico docking of various ligands into the active site of the X-ray structure of the enzyme suggests an unusual catalytic mechanism involving an arginine residue as a proton donor. Given the critical importance of thyroid hormones in brain function this research further expands on our knowledge of the connection between amino acid metabolism and regulation of thyroid hormone levels.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8608453,The influence of the choroid plexus on the concentration of prealbumin in CSF,"Prealbumin and albumin concentrations were measured in homogenates of choroid plexus, ventricular and lumbar CSF, and in serum. The passive permeability-independent prealbumin concentration was estimated by subtracting from the total concentration that portion which enters the plexus and CSF by a passive molecular sieve effect, assuming that the diffusion of albumin and prealbumin is similar. The passive permeability-independent prealbumin concentration was highest in homogenates of the choroid plexus (mean = 56 micrograms/g). It was almost 3 times that in ventricular CSF (mean = 18 micrograms/ml). The passive permeability-independent concentration decreased only slightly during passage from the ventricular to the lumbar CSF space (mean = 16 micrograms/ml). These data suggest that much of the prealbumin in CSF enters the ventricular CSF via the choroid plexus by a mechanism different from that responsible for the transit of albumin.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8608452,Modifications of physical and functional integrity of the blood-brain barrier in an inducible mouse model of neurodegeneration,"The inducible p25 overexpression mouse model recapitulate many hallmark features of Alzheimer's disase including progressive neuronal loss, elevated Aβ, tau pathology, cognitive dysfunction, and impaired synaptic plasticity. We chose p25 mice to evaluate the physical and functional integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a context of Tau pathology (pTau) and severe neurodegeneration, at an early (3 weeks ON) and a late (6 weeks ON) stage of the pathology. Using in situ brain perfusion and confocal imaging, we found that the brain vascular surface area and the physical integrity of the BBB were unaltered in p25 mice. However, there was a significant 14% decrease in cerebrovascular volume in 6 weeks ON mice, possibly explained by a significant 27% increase of collagen IV in the basement membrane of brain capillaries. The function of the BBB transporters GLUT1 and LAT1 was evaluated by measuring brain uptake of d-glucose and phenylalanine, respectively. In 6 weeks ON p25 mice, d-glucose brain uptake was significantly reduced by about 17% compared with WT, without any change in the levels of GLUT1 protein or mRNA in brain capillaries. The brain uptake of phenylalanine was not significantly reduced in p25 mice compared with WT. Lack of BBB integrity, impaired BBB d-glucose transport have been observed in several mouse models of AD. In contrast, reduced cerebrovascular volume and an increased basement membrane thickness may be more specifically associated with pTau in mouse models of neurodegeneration.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8608402,[Perinatal relation of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and its effect on protein composition of the cerebrospinal fluid],"The lumbar spinal fluid of 70 infants aged 238-461 days after conception was examined for total protein with the Cu-Folin-differential test, and for variation of single CSF proteins as a function of developmental age using agar gel electrophoresis. In the early stages of development all CSF fractions as well as total protein are increased compared with adult persons. The absolute amounts decrease after birth more or less rapidly (partly exponentially) and reach a minimum between the 52nd and 57th week of development (prealbumin and beta 1-globulin somewhat earlier, albumin somewhat later). Except for beta 1-globulin this minimum is always lower than the normal adult values. There seems to be a linear correlation between the logarithm of the total protein (also of certain single proteins) and the gestational age over a wide range of development. The behaviour of the haptoglobin and immunoglobulin fractions demonstrates especially well that many independent factors may simultaneously influence the concentration of the CSF proteins (e.g. plasma content of proteins, permeability of the blood/brain or blood/CSF barrier) and that these factors themselves depend on both the developmental state (gestational age) and chronological age (birth). This study, in agreement with the results of other authors suggests that in human neonates the reference range of those CSF parameters which depend on barrier conditions should be related to the gestational age rather than to the chronological age.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Specimens from other organs were investigated in one of the patients, and amyloid angiopathy characterized by an immunoreactivity of cystatin C was found in a submandibular lymph node. No immunoreactivity of amyloid fibril protein AA, kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chain, or prealbumin was observed. Significantly low cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of cystatin C were found in all 9 investigated individuals with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis. The concentrations of beta 2-microglobulin, albumin, and IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid were within normal limits. Isoelectric focusing showed that cystatin C from the cerebrospinal fluid of 9 patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis had an isoelectric point identical to that of normal individuals.

8627709,Novel neural pathways for metabolic effects of thyroid hormone,"The relation between thyrotoxicosis, the clinical syndrome resulting from exposure to excessive thyroid hormone concentrations, and the sympathetic nervous system remains enigmatic. Nevertheless, beta-adrenergic blockers are widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues (e.g. thyronamines).

8608392,[A cerebrospinal fluid syndrome in neurocysticercosis],"The study is based on 371 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and 324 serum samples from 40 patients with neurocysticercosis (NC) submitted to treatment with praziquantel. The aim of the study is a critical evaluation on humoral immunity in CSF NC syndrome. The analysis of NC patients at diagnosis and in the follow-up period was performed considering three connected criteria: the clinical one, the CSF examination and the computed tomography. For the study of CSF and serum samples a systematization of collection was scheduled in relation to: diagnosis; period of treatment; follow-up. A total of 13 samples for each case for a follow-up period of two years was scheduled. For the study of humoral immunity a semiquantitative methodology was employed to verify the intra blood-brain barrier (BBB) gamma globulins synthesis. It was based upon electrophoretic profile data on CSF and serum proteins, and relations and indexes. Normal values were previously characterized in a normal control group. This group was formed by 50 patients with chronic headache who presented normal neurological examination, as well as, CSF-examination and serum proteinogram under the safety limits of normality. To verify intra BBB gamma globulins synthesis it was considered the gamma globulin content of the CSF and serum, the gamma globulins/prealbumin + albumin relationship, the Link and Tibbling index, the intra BBB gamma globulins synthesis of Tourtellotte and col., and the appearance of oligoclonal bands in the CSF. Confirmation of the disease was performed by immunological reactions for cysticercosis: complement fixation test in CSF and serum; immunofluorescent test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in CSF. Interference factors in the CSF NC syndrome were analysed at first such as those related to: clinical aspects, time of disease, previous dependence on corticotherapy, ventricular derivation shunts, tomographic findings. It was shown that all of them produce several degrees of interference in the intensity of the CSF NC syndrome. Data on intra BBB gamma globulins synthesis were verified in 37 patients (92.5%). It occurred in a persistent pattern in 18 cases (45%) during all the study phases, and not showed changes that might be related to treatment. On the other hand, it was shown that analysis of the results must always be performed case by case due to large dispersion of events observed and the differences of behavior of data related to humoral immunity, when critically analysed during diagnosis, treatment period and in the follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

To test this, we examined post-mortem tissue from 14 long-term haemodialysis patients, ten with dialysis arthropathy and four without arthropathy. Tissue was obtained from the shoulder, knee, or hip joints and the following organs: brain, kidney, liver, heart, lung, spleen, and rectum. Congo-red stain was used to identify amyloid deposits and these were characterised further using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique with antibodies to beta 2-M, prealbumin, serum amyloid A protein, and kappa and lambda light chains. All patients with arthropathy had large deposits of beta 2-M amyloid in the articular tissues. In contrast to this, systemic amyloid deposits were only found in four patients and were small and mainly confined to vessel walls. The four patients without joint symptoms had no evidence of systemic or articular amyloidosis. In addition, subcutaneous fat aspirations were carried out in 13 patients with dialysis arthropathy and 12 without arthropathy. Amyloid deposits were only found in two patients with arthropathy. Our results show that dialysis-associated amyloidosis has a predilection for deposition in articular tissues, and that systemic deposits are infrequent, small, and mainly confined to vessel walls.

The concentration of each plasma protein in CSF was found to vary during the gestational period in relation to its serum levels and rate of synthesis and as a consequence of a reduced permeability of the blood-CSF barrier after 22 weeks. In fact, the higher CSF levels of AFP were detected in fetuses about 16 weeks old, while the highest values of albumin were observed in CSF from fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks old. Experimental work has shown that also in rats the permeability of the blood-CSF barrier is incomplete during fetal and perinatal life. When 125I-labelled albumin and IgG or 14C-oestrogen and testosterone were injected intraperitoneally in newborn rats, the labelled proteins and hormones were detected in fetal blood and CSF four hours after the injection.

Many neurons of the spinal cord, cranial nerve nuclei, pontine nuclei, cerebellar dentate nucleus, red nucleus, thalamus and hypothalamus showed strong immunostaining for albumin and moderate to strong staining for alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, IgG, transferrin, haptoglobin, as well as relatively weak immunoreactivity against other plasma proteins. Less intense staining was seen in the nucleus basalis, putamen and Purkinje cells. In contrast, most cerebral cortical neurons were negative except for a few positively stained pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and in layers III and V of the association neocortex, although more positive pyramidal neurons were observed in the motor and sensory neocortices. Reaction products were also seen in axons of motor and sensory long tracts.

8632179,Decreased pain threshold and enhanced synaptic transmission in the anterior cingulate cortex of experimental hypothyroidism mice,"Background: Thyroid hormones are essential for the maturation and functions of the central nervous system. Pain sensitivity is related to the thyroid status. However, information on how thyroid hormones affect pain processing and synaptic transmission in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is limited. Nociceptive threshold and synaptic transmission in the ACC were detected in the experimental hypothyroidism (HT) mice. Results: HT was induced by methimazole and potassium perchlorate in distilled drinking water for 4 weeks. The threshold of pain perception to hot insults, but not mechanical ones, decreased in hypothyroid mice. After treatment with tri-iodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4) for 2 weeks, thermal pain threshold recovered. Electrophysiological recordings revealed enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission and reduced GABAergic synaptic transmission in the ACC. Supplementation with T3 or T4 significantly rescued this synaptic transmission imbalance. In the same model, HT caused the up-regulation of the GluR1 subunit of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor and NR2B-containingN-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, but it down-regulated gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors in the ACC. Supplementation with T3 or T4 notably recovered the levels of above proteins.

There was no family history related to endemic Japanese foci (Nagano and Kumamoto foci). He demonstrated paraesthesia in the legs and mild autonomic symptoms at the age of 52. These symptoms gradually developed. Analysis of the transthyretin gene from his leucocytes demonstrated he had Met 30 transthyretin mutation. Therefore, he was diagnosed with late-onset familial amyloid polyneuropathy type I(FAP 1). In some families, asymptomatic carriers with the mutant transthyretin gene were diagnosed.

8627699,Tissue distribution and cardiac metabolism of 3-iodothyronamine,"3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) is a novel relative of thyroid hormone, able to interact with specific G protein-coupled receptors, known as trace amine-associated receptors. Significant functional effects are produced by exogenous T1AM, including a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect in cardiac preparations. This work was aimed at estimating endogenous T1AM concentration in different tissues and determining its cardiac metabolism. A novel HPLC tandem mass spectrometry assay was developed, allowing detection of T1AM, thyronamine, 3-iodothyroacetic acid, and thyroacetic acid. T1AM was detected in rat serum, at the concentration of 0.3±0.03 pmol/ml, and in all tested organs (heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, stomach, lung, and brain), at concentrations significantly higher than the serum concentration, ranging from 5.6±1.5 pmol/g in lung to 92.9±28.5 pmol/g in liver. T1AM was also identified for the first time in human blood. In H9c2 cardiomyocytes and isolated perfused rat hearts, significant Na+-dependent uptake of exogenous T1AM was observed, and at the steady state total cellular or tissue T1AM concentration exceeded extracellular concentration by more than 20-fold. In both preparations T1AM underwent oxidative deamination to 3-iodothyroacetic acid. T1AM deamination was inhibited by iproniazid but not pargyline or semicarbazide, suggesting the involvement of both monoamine oxidase and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase. Thyronamine and thyroacetic acid were not detected in heart. Finally, evidence of T1AM production was observed in cardiomyocytes exposed to exogenous thyroid hormone, although the activity of this pathway was very low.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8608497,Biomarkers in volunteers exposed to mobile phone radiation,"For some time it has been investigated whether low-intensity non-thermal microwave radiation from mobile phones adversely affects the mammalian blood-brain barrier (BBB). All such studies except one have been either in vitro or experimental animal studies. The one carried out on humans showed a statistically significant increase in serum transthyretin (TTR) 60 min after finishing of a 30-min microwave exposure session. The aim of the present study was to follow up on the finding of the previous one using a better study design. Using biomarkers analyzed in blood serum before and after the exposure this single blinded randomized counterbalanced study, including 24 healthy subjects aged 18-30 years that all underwent three exposure conditions (SAR(10G)=2 W/kg, SAR(10G)=0.2 W/kg, sham), tested whether microwaves from an 890-MHz phone-like signal give acute effects on the integrity of brain-shielding barriers. Over time, statistically significant variations were found for two of the three biomarkers (TTR; β-trace protein); however, no such difference was found between the different exposure conditions nor was there any interaction between exposure condition and time of blood sampling. In conclusion this study failed to show any acute clinically or statistically significant effect of short term microwave exposure on the serum levels of S100β, TTR and β-trace protein with a follow up limited to two hours.

8627700,3-iodothyronamine decreases expression of genes involved in iodide metabolism in mouse thyroids and inhibits iodide uptake in PCCL3 thyrocytes,"Background: 3-Iodothyronamine (3-T1AM) is an endogenous decarboxylated thyroid hormone (TH) metabolite. Pharmacological doses of 3-T1AM decrease heart rate, body temperature, and metabolic rate in rodents-effects that are contrary to classic TH excess. Furthermore, a single dose of 3-T1AM was shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in rats. It was hypothesized that 3-T1AM might play a role in the fine-tuning of TH action and might have a direct regulatory effect on the thyroid gland. Methods: This study tested whether repeated 3-T1AM treatment interfered with thyroid function and the HPT axis in mice. Therefore, male C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg/kg of 3-T1AM or vehicle daily for seven days. Additionally, the effects of 3-T1AM on the differentiated rat thyrocyte cell line PCCL3 were analyzed. Results: Repeated administration of 3-T1AM decreased thyroidal mRNA content of the sodium iodide symporter (Nis), thyroglobulin, and pendrin in mice. No interference with the HPT axis was observed, as determined by unaltered pituitary mRNA levels of triiodothyronine-responsive genes, including thyrotropin subunit β. Furthermore, 3-T1AM treatment did not change transcript levels of hepatic triiodothyronine-responsive genes, such as deiodinase 1. In line with this, serum TH concentrations were not changed after the treatment period of seven days. In concordance with the in vivo findings, 3-T1AM decreased the thyrotropin-dependent expression of Nis and functional iodide uptake in PCCL3 cells in vitro. Additionally, uptake and metabolism of 3-T1AM by PCCL3 cells was observed, as well as 3-T1AM-dependent changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that might be involved in mediating the reported effects. Conclusions: In conclusion, 3-T1AM application decreased expression of selected TH synthesis genes by acting directly on the thyroid gland, and it might therefore affect TH synthesis without involvement of the HPT axis.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8608488,Transthyretin stability is critical in assisting beta amyloid clearance- Relevance of transthyretin stabilization in Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: The absence of transthyretin (TTR) in AD mice decreases brain Aβ clearance and reduces the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). It is possible that neuroprotection by TTR is dependent on its tetramer structural stability, as studies using TTR mutants showed that unstable L55P TTR has low affinity for Aβ, and TTR tetrameric stabilizers such as iododiflunisal ameliorate AD features in vivo. METHODS: We firstly investigated TTR folding status in human plasma measuring the resistance to urea denaturation. The importance of TTR stability on Aβ internalization was studied in human cerebral microvascular endothelial (hCMEC/D3) and hepatoma cells (HepG2), by flow cytometry. To investigate the fate of Aβ at the blood-brain barrier, Aβ efflux from hCMEC/D3 cells seeded on transwells was measured using ELISA. Further, to assess Aβ colocalization with lysosomes, Lysotracker was used. Moreover, levels of LRP1 were assessed in the liver and plasma of mice with different TTR backgrounds or treated with iododiflunisal. RESULTS: We showed that TTR stability is decreased in AD and that WT TTR and drug-stabilized L55P TTR are able to increase uptake of Aβ. Furthermore, measurement of Aβ efflux showed that stable or stabilized TTR increased Aβ efflux from the basolateral to the apical side. Moreover, HepG2 cells incubated with Aβ in the presence of WT TTR, but not L55P TTR, showed an increased number of lysosomes. Further, in the presence of WT TTR, Aβ peptide colocalized with lysosomes, indicating that only stable TTR assists Aβ internalization, leading to its degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that only stable TTR can increase LRP1 levels. CONCLUSION: TTR stabilization exerts a positive effect on Aβ clearance and LRP1 levels, suggesting that TTR protective role in AD is dependent on its stability. These results provide relevant information for the design of TTR-based therapeutic strategies for AD.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8627701,Torpor: The Rise and Fall of 3-Monoiodothyronamine from Brain to Gut-From Gut to Brain?,"3-Monoiodothyronamine (T1AM), first isolated from rat brain, is reported to be an endogenous, rapidly acting metabolite of thyroxine. One of its numerous effects is the induction of a ""torpor-like"" state in experimental animals. A critical analysis of T1AM, to serve as an endogenous cryogen, is given. The proposed biosynthetic pathway for formation of T1AM, which includes deiodinases and ornithine decarboxylase in the upper intestinum, is an unusual one. To reach the brain via systemic circulation, enterohepatic recycling and passage through the liver may occur. The possible role of gut microbiota is discussed. T1AM concentrations in human serum, measured by a specific monoclonal assay are up to three orders of magnitude higher compared to values obtained by MS/MS technology. The difference is explained by the presence of a high-affinity binder for T1AM (Apolipoprotein B-100) in serum, which permits the immunoassay to measure the total concentration of the analyte but limits MS/MS technology to detect only the unbound (free) analyte, a view, which is contested here.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The 6.0-hMet30 gene was expressed in the yolk sac, liver, and choroid plexus, where the mouse endogenous TTR gene is also expressed. In contrast, expression of the 0.6-hMet30 gene was restricted to the yolk sac and liver. The expression levels of the 6.0-hMet30 gene in the liver and serum were similar to those of the mouse TTR gene, and about 10-fold those of the 0.6-hMet30 gene. Before birth, the developmental profiles of the expression of both transgenes in each tissue were similar to those of the mouse TTR gene. However, the expression levels of the 6.0-hMet30 gene in the liver and serum increased after birth to reach adult levels at an age of 4 weeks, while expression of the 0.6-hMet30 gene remained at a low level after birth.

8593285,Transthyretin is involved in depression-like behaviour and exploratory activity,"Transthyretin (TTR), the major transporter of thyroid hormones and vitamin A in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), binds the Alzheimer beta-peptide and thus might confer protection against neurodegeneration. In addition, altered TTR levels have been described in the CSF of patients with psychiatric disorders, yet its function in the CNS is far from understood. To determine the role of TTR in behaviour we evaluated the performance of TTR-null mice in standardized tasks described to assess depression, exploratory activity and anxiety. We show that the absence of TTR is associated with increased exploratory activity and reduced signs of depressive-like behaviour. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying these alterations, we measured the levels of catecholamines. We found that the levels of noradrenaline were significantly increased in the limbic forebrain of TTR-null mice.

During the last years, TAAR1 arose as a promising druggable target in medicinal chemistry, being of interest in the treatment of several pathologies, such as neuropsychiatric disorders, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Nevertheless, the limited number of known potent and selective ligands and the species-specificity responsiveness exhibited by those derivatives nowadays available make the discovery of novel compounds a challenging task. Herein, we discuss the development of two quantitative-structure activity relationship (QSAR) models around the agonism ability experienced by different chemo-types toward murine and human TAAR1 (m/hTAAR1) with the aim at deciphering some clues involved in their species-specificity responsiveness. Qualitatively, these information were evaluated guiding for the synthesis of novel ligands, which proved to feature selective agonism ability with respect to the mTAAR1 and hTAAR1 orthologues.

8627703,"Novel thyroxine derivatives, thyronamine and 3-iodothyronamine, induce transient hypothermia and marked neuroprotection against stroke injury","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild hypothermia confers profound neuroprotection in ischemia. We recently discovered 2 natural derivatives of thyroxine, 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and thyronamine (T(0)AM), that when administered to rodents lower body temperature for several hours without induction of a compensatory homeostatic response. We tested whether T(1)AM- and T(0)AM-induced hypothermia protects against brain injury from experimental stroke. METHODS: We tested T(1)AM and T(0)AM 1 hour after and 2 days before stroke in a mouse model of focal ischemia. To determine whether T(1)AM and T(0)AM require hypothermia to protect against stroke injury, the induction of hypothermia was prevented. RESULTS: T(1)AM and T(0)AM administration reduced body temperature from 37 degrees C to 31 degrees C. Mice given T(1)AM or T(0)AM after the ischemic period had significantly smaller infarcts compared with controls. Mice preconditioned with T(1)AM before ischemia displayed significantly smaller infarcts compared with controls. Pre- and postischemia treatments required the induction of hypothermia. T(1)AM and T(0)AM treatment in vitro failed to confer neuroprotection against ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: T(1)AM and T(0)AM, are potent neuroprotectants in acute stroke and T(1)AM can be used as antecedent treatment to induce neuroprotection against subsequent ischemia. Hypothermia induced by T(1)AM and T(0)AM may underlie neuroprotection.

8632178,Iodothyronine deiodinases and cancer,"Thyroid hormones (TH) regulate key cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in virtually all human cells. Disturbances in TH pathway and the resulting deregulation of these processes have been linked with neoplasia. The concentrations of TH in peripheral tissues are regulated via the activity of iodothyronine deiodinases. There are 3 types of these enzymes: type 1 and type 2 deiodinases are involved in TH activation while type 3 deiodinase inactivates TH. Expression and activity of iodothyronine deiodinases are disturbed in different types of neoplasia. According to the limited number of studies in cancer cell lines and mouse models changes in intratumoral and extratumoral T-3 concentrations may influence proliferation rate and metastatic progression. Recent findings showing that increased expression of type 3 deiodinases may lead to enhanced tumoral proliferation support the idea that deiodinating enzymes have the potential to influence cancer progression. This review summarizes the observations of impaired expression and activity in different cancer types, published to date, and the mechanisms behind these alterations, including impaired regulation via TH receptors, transforming growth factor-beta, and Sonic-hedgehog pathway. Possible roles of deiodinases as cancer markers and potential modulators of tumor progression are also discussed. (J. Endocrinol.

The epithelium of choroidal cysts, showed strong immunoreactivity for Prealbumin and cytokeratins, similar to the normal choroid plexus epithelium. The ependymal cysts showed epithelial immunoreactivity for GFAP and S-100, both glial markers expressed by the normal ependymal epithelium. On the contrary, the epithelial wall of colloid cysts and Rathke's cleft cyst, expressed epithelial markers (cytokeratins and EMA) but no neuroepithelial markers, with a immuno-phenotype similar to that of other cysts of endodermal nature.

Two new therapies-inotersen, an antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and patisiran, an RNA interference therapy-received marketing authorization and represent a significant advance in the treatment of amyloidosis. Herein, we describe the clinical presentation of ATTR, commonly used procedures in its diagnosis, and current treatment landscape for ATTR, with a focus on hATTR.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>A PubMed search from 2008 to September 2018 was conducted to review the literature on ATTR.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Until recently, there have been few treatment options for polyneuropathy of hATTR. Inotersen and patisiran substantially reduce the amyloidogenic precursor protein transthyretin and have demonstrated efficacy in patients with early- and late-stage disease and in slowing or improving neuropathy progression. In contrast, established therapies, such as liver transplantation, typically reserved for patients with early-stage disease, and tafamidis, indicated for the treatment of early-stage disease in Europe, or diflunisal, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is used off-label, are associated with side effects and/or unclear efficacy in certain patient populations. Thus, inotersen and patisiran are positioned to be the preferred therapeutic modalities.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Important differences between inotersen and patisiran, including formulation, dosing, requirements for premedications, and safety monitoring, require an understanding and knowledge of each treatment for informed decision making.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8608483,Destabilised human transthyretin shapes the morphology of calcium carbonate crystals,"Human transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetramer that transports thyroid hormones and retinol in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. TTR is also an intracellular protein found in tissues such as those in the brain, eye and pancreas. TTR is a nutrition marker, reflecting the health of the organism, and TTR levels are linked to the normal and diseased states of the body. The switch from a protective to a pathological role is attributed to the destabilisation of the TTR structure, which leads to tetramer dissociation and amyloid formation. Native and destabilised TTR have been associated with osteoarthritis and bone density in humans. Moreover, TTR is present in eggshell mammillary cones; therefore, we verified the putative TTR engagement in the process of mineral formation. Using an in vitro assay, we found that TTR affected calcium carbonate crystal growth and morphology, producing asymmetric crystals with a complex nanocrystalline composition. The crystals possessed rounded edges and corners and irregular etch pits, suggesting the selective inhibition of crystal growth and/or dissolution imposed by TTR. The occurrence of many porosities, fibrillary inclusions and amorphous precipitates suggested that destabilisation of the TTR structure is an important factor involved in the mineralisation process. Crystals grown in the presence of TTR exhibited the characteristic features of crystals controlled by biomineralisation-active proteins, suggesting novel functions of TTR in the mineral formation process.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

As 3-iodothyronamine is rapidly acetylated in vivo after injection, it was hypothesized that the metabolites N- or O-acetyl-3-iodothyronamines could constitute the active hormones. METHODS: Adult male mice were injected once daily with one of the metabolites (5 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally dissolved in 60% DMSO in PBS) or solvent. Metabolism was monitored by indirect calorimetry, body temperature by infrared thermography, and body composition by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Signaling activities in brown fat or liver were assessed by studying target gene transcription by qPCR including uncoupling protein 1 or deiodinase type 1 or 2, and Western blot. RESULTS: The markers of metabolism, body composition, or temperature tested were similar in the mice injected with solvent and those injected with one of the acetylated 3-iodothyronamines. CONCLUSIONS: In our experimental setup, N- and O-acetyl-3-iodothyronamine do not constitute compounds contributing to the metabolic or temperature effects described for 3-iodothyronamine.

This study delineated the clinical characteristics of pediatric Hashimoto encephalopathy and the significance of low antithyroid antibody titers in diagnosis and treatment. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Clinical manifestations, antibody titers, and treatment responses were retrospectively reviewed in six consecutive children diagnosed with Hashimoto encephalopathy between August 2008 and July 2016. RESULTS: Age at diagnosis was 10-17years. Presenting symptoms were seizures, altered consciousness, behavioral changes, psychosis, tremor, and dystonia. Thyroid function was normal in five patients, and one had hypothyroidism prior to the encephalopathy. Antithyroid antibody titer was increased at presentation in five patients and one week later in the other. Antibody levels were extremely varied (anti-thyroglobulin, 20.5-2318.0U/ml; anti-thyroid peroxidase, 12.5-2231.0U/ml; reference range, <60U/ml) and <180U/ml in two patients. Electroencephalogram was abnormal in five patients. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable. Four patients responded to high-dose corticosteroid and one improved with additional intravenous immunoglobulin. The remaining patient did not respond to both treatments and normalized after plasmapheresis. Autoantibody titers decreased with treatment response in the acute stage. Two patients with low antibody titers showed similar clinical presentations and responses. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentations and treatment responses in Hashimoto encephalopathy were similar, irrespective of antithyroid antibody titer.

Members of the CAT family transport predominantly cationic amino acids by facilitating diffusion with intracellular substrates. LAT1 (also known as SLC7A5), is defined as a heteromeric amino acid transporter (HAT) interacting with the glycoprotein CD98 (SLC3A2) through a conserved disulfide to uptake not only large neutral amino acids, but also several pharmaceutical drugs to cells.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>In this review, we provide an overview of the interaction of the structure-function of LAT1 and its essential role in cancer, specifically, its role at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to facilitate the transport of thyroid hormones, pharmaceuticals (e.g., I-DOPA, gabapentin), and metabolites into the brain.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>LAT1 expression increases as cancers progress, leading to higher expression levels in highgrade tumors and metastases. In addition, LAT1 plays a crucial role in cancer-associated reprogrammed metabolic networks by supplying tumor cells with essential amino acids.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>The increasing understanding of the role of LAT1 in cancer has led to an increase in interest surrounding its potential as a drug target for cancer treatment.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8601002,Plasma growth differentiation factor 15: a novel tool to detect early changes of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis,"<strong>AIMS: </strong>Hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis is the most frequent and representative form of autosomal dominant hereditary systemic amyloidosis. Disease-modifying treatments of the disease are more effective during the early stages, and we require biomarkers to detect early pathological changes for prompt diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate whether plasma growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) levels could aid detection of early pathological changes in ATTRv amyloidosis.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>We retrospectively studied 32 patients with ATTRv amyloidosis, eight asymptomatic TTR mutation carriers, and eight healthy volunteers. We evaluated plasma GDF-15 levels in these subjects as related to levels of brain natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiographic features, 99m Tc-pyrophosphate (PYP) scans, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings. Plasma GDF-15 levels significantly increased even in asymptomatic TTR mutation carriers compared with healthy volunteers (P < 0.01). Plasma GDF-15 levels were significantly correlated with plasma brain natriuretic peptide values (P < 0.01), serum high-sensitivity troponin T values (P < 0.05), and interventricular septal thickness at end-diastole (P < 0.01) in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis. Plasma GDF-15 levels in patients with PYP-positive ATTRv amyloidosis were significantly higher than those in patients with PYP-negative ATTRv amyloidosis (P < 0.01). Plasma GDF-15 levels in patients with late gadolinium enhancement-positive ATTRv amyloidosis were significantly higher than those in patients with late gadolinium enhancement-negative ATTRv amyloidosis (P < 0.01). Groups of patients with different TTR genotypes manifested different plasma GDF-15 levels.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Growth differentiation factor 15 may reflect early pathological changes of ATTRv amyloidosis.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

TTR was demonstrated diffusely and strongly in the cytoplasm of normal choroid plexus cells, but not in ependyma and other tissues of normal brain. In all of 10 choroid plexus papillomas, TTR was found within the cytoplasm of tumor cells. In contrast, neither the two papillary ependymomas nor any other brain tumors contained TTR. Among the choroid plexus papillomas, some cases showed clear positive reactions in almost all tumor cells, while others had only a few TTR-positive cells.

The panel of antibodies applied included anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), anti-vimentin (VM), anti-S-100 protein (S-100 P), anti-cytokeratin, and anti-prealbumin antisera. All ependymomas and astroblastomas examined expressed both VM and GFAP, which were either absent or focally expressed in choroid plexus tumors. In contrast, all choroid plexus tumors showed anti-cytokeratin immunoreactivity that was absent in the ependymomas and astroblastomas. Five choroid plexus tumors also expressed S-100 P, thus differentiating them from metastatic carcinoma that showed negative immunostaining. Anti-CEA antisera immunoreactivity was seen in six metastatic tumors, whereas none of the primary CNS tumors expressed CEA. Prealbumin was expressed in four choroid plexus tumors and two metastatic tumors.

8627705,In vivo effects of repeated thyronamine administration in male c57bl/6j mice,"Objectives: Thyronamines are decarboxylated and deiodinated metabolites of thyroid hormones (THs). Of all possible thyronamine variants, only 3-iodothyronamine (3-T(1)AM) and iodine-free thyronamine (T(0)AM) have been detected in vivo. While intensive research has been done on the (patho-) physiological action of 3-T(1)AM, the role of T(0)AM has been studied less intensively. Study Design: We determined whether a single pharmacological dose (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or repeated administration (5 mg/kg/day, i.p., for 7 days) of T(0)AM affects metabolism, cardiovascular function, or thermoregulation in male C57BL/6J mice. Since selenium (Se) is important for proper TH function and Se metabolism is affected by TH, we additionally analyzed Se concentrations in liver, serum, and kidney using total reflection X-ray analysis. Results: A single injection of T(0)AM had no effect on heart rate, temperature, or activity as assessed by radio telemetry. Likewise, daily administration of T(0)AM did not alter body weight, food or water intake, heart rate, blood pressure, brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, or body temperature, and no significant differences in hepatic glycogen content or mRNA expression of genes involved in cardiovascular function or metabolic control were determined. Also, the Xray analysis of Se concentrations revealed no significant changes. However, hepatic T(0)AM was significantly increased in the treated animals. Conclusions: In summary, our data demonstrate that T(0)AM elicits no obvious metabolic, cardiovascular, or thermoregulatory activities in mice. As T(0)AM does also not interfere with TH or Se metabolism, we conclude that the deiodination of 3-T(1)AM to T(0)AM constitutes an efficient inactivation mechanism, terminating the actions of the more powerful precursor.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

We examined 5 brains with dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), a peripheral nerves of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (variant transthyretin type, FAP) and dorsal root ganglions of a primary amyloidosis with peripheral neuropathy (AL type, PA). Avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method and double immunoenzymatic staining method (peroxidase-antiperoxidase method combined with avidin-biotin-alkaline phosphatase complex method) were used. Anti-beta protein serum was used as the marker of cerebral amyloid. About 98% of senile plaques had alpha 1ACT like-immunoreactivity (alpha 1ACTI). All types of plaques showed the immunoreactivity: Core and peripheral of typical plaques, primitive plaques, core plaques and amorphous cerebral amyloid deposits. Although, a part of a senile plaque showed beta protein like-immunoreactivity alone and the other part had alpha 1ACT, many remainder part of a senile plaque had both immunoreactivity. Of the other pathological changes of SDAT, eosinophilic tangles and cerebrovascular amyloid were positive, in contrast, intracellular tangles, granulovacuolar degeneration and Hirano body were negative.

8593326,Developmental profile of plasma proteins in human fetal cerebrospinal fluid and blood,"Total protein, alphafetoprotein, albumin, prealbumin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, transferrin and ceruloplasmin levels were measured in samples of human fetal and neonatal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (97 cases), obtained between 12 and 41 weeks of gestation. In 39 of these cases (13 to 40 weeks gestation) plasma was also available for comparative analysis. CSF was collected from lateral ventricles in the first half of gestation and from the lumbar region in the second. Since these CSF samples were obtained from different sites, the protein levels in the lateral ventricle (early) samples could not be compared directly with those in the lumbar (later) samples. However, the mean protein levels in the lumbar samples were lower than those in the ventricular samples, which is in accord with the decline in CSF protein levels described in maturing animal fetuses. Despite a wide scatter of results, particularly in the first half of gestation, significant decline in the level of CSF alphafetoprotein was demonstrated during both first and second halves of gestation, and of albumin and prealbumin in the second half. No sex differences were found except for ceruloplasmin in lumbar CSF later in gestation, when males had higher levels than females. In fetal plasma, protein levels increased with increasing gestation apart from alphafetoprotein and prealbumin which both declined progressively. CSF/plasma ratios were dissimilar for different proteins, and changed with increasing gestation.

8601113,"Large-Scale Quantitative Comparison of Plasma Transmembrane Proteins between Two Human Blood-Brain Barrier Model Cell Lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ","Transmembrane (TM) proteins localized at the plasma membrane, such as transporters and receptors, play important roles in regulating the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The purpose of the present study was to clarify the differences in the expression levels of TM proteins in the plasma membrane between two established human BBB model cell lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ, in order to assist researchers in selecting the most appropriate cell line for particular purposes. We first confirmed that plasma membranes could be enriched sufficiently for a quantitative proteomics study by using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit provided by BioVision with a modified protocol. This method was applied to hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ cells, and fractions were used for untargeted quantitative proteomics based on sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra. In the plasma membrane fractions, 345 TM proteins were quantified, among which 135 showed significant expression differences between the two cell lines. In hCMEC/D3 cells, amino acid transporters SNAT1, SNAT2, SNAT5, ASCT1, CAT1, and LAT1; adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding cassette transporters P-gp and MRP4; and GLUT1 were more highly expressed. The transferrin receptor expression was also 4.56-fold greater in hCMEC/D3 cells. In contrast, HBMEC/ciβ cells expressed greater levels of IgG transporter neonatal Fc receptor, as well as tight-junction proteins PECAM1, JAM1, JAM3, and ESAM. Our results suggest that hCMEC/D3 cells have greater efflux transport, amino acid transport, and transferrin receptor-mediated uptake activities, whereas HBMEC/ciβ cells have greater IgG-transport activity and tight-junction integrity.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8632166,Thyroid Hormones and Derivatives: Endogenous Thyroid Hormones and Their Targets,"More than a century after the discovery of L-Thyroxine, the main thyroid hormone secreted solely by the thyroid gland, several metabolites of this iodinated, tyrosine-derived ancestral hormone have been identified. These are utilized as hormones during development, differentiation, metamorphosis, and regulation of most biochemical reactions in vertebrates and their precursor species. Among those metabolites are the thyromimetically active 3,3', 5-Triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and 3,5-Diiodo-L-thronine, reverse-T3 (3,3', 5'-Triiodo-L-thyronine) with still unclear function, the recently re-discovered thyronamines (e.g., 3-Iodo-thyronamine), which exert in part T3-antagonistic functions, the thyroacetic acids (e.g., Tetrac and Triac), as well as various sulfated or glucuronidated metabolites of this panel of iodinated signaling compounds. In the blood most of these hydrophobic metabolites are tightly bound to the serum distributor proteins thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR), albumin or apolipoprotein B100. Cellular import and export of these charged, highly hydrophobic amino acid derivatives requires a number of cell-membrane transporters or facilitators such as MCT8 or MCT10 and members of the OATP and LAT families of transporters. Depending on their structure, the thyroid hormone metabolites exert their cellular action by binding and thus modulating the function of various receptors systems (e.g., alpha nu beta 3 integrin receptor and transient receptor potential channels (TRPM8) of the cell membrane), in part linked to intracellular downstream kinase signaling cascades, and several isoforms of membrane-associated, mitochondrial or nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TR), which are members of the c-erbA family of ligand-modulated transcription factors. Intracellular deiodinase selenoenzymes, which obligatory are membrane integrated enzymes, ornithine decarboxylase and monoamine oxidases control local availability of biologically active thyroid hormone metabolites. Inactivation of thyroid hormone metabolites occurs mainly by deiodination, sulfation or glucuronidation, reactions which favor their renal or fecal elimination.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
8601482,The biological and chemical basis for tissue-selective amyloid disease,"Factors controlling the onset and progression of extracellular amyloid diseases remain largely unknown. Central to disease etiology is the efficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) machinery that targets destabilized mutant proteins for degradation and the enhanced tendency of these variants to aggregate if secreted. We demonstrate that mammalian cells secrete numerous transthyretin (TTR) disease-associated variants with wild-type efficiency in spite of compromised folding energetics. Only the most highly destabilized TTR variants are subjected to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and then only in certain tissues, providing insight into tissue selective amyloidosis. Rather than a ""quality control"" standard based on wild-type stability, we find that ER-assisted folding (ERAF), based on global protein energetics, determines the extent of export. We propose that ERAF (influenced by the energetics of the protein fold, chaperone enzyme distributions, and metabolite chaperones) in competition with ERAD defines the unique secretory aptitude of each tissue.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
8608339,Glioblastoma Exhibits Inter-Individual Heterogeneity of TSPO and LAT1 Expression in Neoplastic and Parenchymal Cells,"Molecular imaging is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning for glioblastoma patients. Positron emission tomography (PET) with tracers for the detection of the solute carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5; also known as the amino acid transporter light chain L system, LAT1) and for the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) is successfully used to provide additional information on tumor volume and prognosis. The current approaches for TSPO-PET and the visualization of tracer ([18F] Fluoroethyltyrosine, FET) uptake by LAT1 (FET-PET) do not yet exploit the full diagnostic potential of these molecular imaging techniques. Therefore, we investigated the expression of TSPO and LAT1 in patient glioblastoma (GBM) samples, as well as in various GBM mouse models representing patient GBMs of different genetic subtypes. By immunohistochemistry, we found that TSPO and LAT1 are upregulated in human GBM samples compared to normal brain tissue. Next, we orthotopically implanted patient-derived GBM cells, as well as genetically engineered murine GBM cells, representing different genetic subtypes of the disease. To determine TSPO and LAT1 expression, we performed immunofluorescence staining. We found that both TSPO and LAT1 expression was increased in tumor regions of the implanted human or murine GBM cells when compared to the neighboring mouse brain tissue. While LAT1 was largely restricted to tumor cells, we found that TSPO was also expressed by microglia, tumor-associated macrophages, endothelial cells, and pericytes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-data analysis corroborates the upregulation of TSPO in a bigger cohort of GBM patient samples compared to tumor-free brain tissue. In addition, AIF1 (the gene encoding for the myeloid cell marker Iba1) was also upregulated in GBM compared to the control. Interestingly, TSPO, as well as AIF1, showed significantly different expression levels depending on the GBM genetic subtype, with the highest expression being exhibited in the mesenchymal subtype. High TSPO and AIF1 expression also correlated with a significant decrease in patient survival compared to low expression. In line with this finding, the expression levels for TSPO and AIF1 were also significantly higher in (isocitrate-dehydrogenase wild-type) IDHWT compared to IDH mutant (IDHMUT) GBM. LAT1 expression, on the other hand, was not different among the individual GBM subtypes. Therefore, we could conclude that FET- and TSPO-PET confer different information on pathological features based on different genetic GBM subtypes and may thus help in planning individualized strategies for brain tumor therapy in the future. A combination of TSPO-PET and FET-PET could be a promising way to visualize tumor-associated myeloid cells and select patients for treatment strategies targeting the myeloid compartment.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8608342,L-Type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1)-utilizing prodrugs are carrier-selective despite having low affinity for organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs),"L-Type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1)-utilizing prodrugs has been designed to improve drug delivery and targeting into the brain or cancer cells, since LAT1 is highly and selectively expressed on the blood-brain barrier as well as over-expressed in several types of cancer. However, less is known about the affinity of these compounds for the secondary transport mechanisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate interactions of nine LAT1-utilizing prodrugs with organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs). These results showed that LAT1-utilizing prodrugs can indeed, interact with OATPs, although it was considered to be minor compared to LAT1; the Km values of these compounds for LAT1 were 1-7 µM while the ones for OATPs were 73-406 µM. Moreover, utilization of LAT1 was 2-12-times more effective (compared as intrinsic clearance) than of OATPs, whose utilization seemed to be less significant at therapeutically used concentrations. According to these results, affinity for OATPs raised from the structural features of the parent drug moiety regardless of the structure of the promoiety. In conclusion, the present study shows that it is important to evaluate secondary transport mechanisms carefully, since they may have a role in pharmacokinetics of LAT1-utilizing prodrugs if LAT1 becomes saturated or un-functional.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8632162,The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines,"Trace amines, including tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), tryptamine and octopamine, are biologically active amines mostly based on phenylethylamine, occurring in the body in trace amounts. They are a diverse group of naturally occurring and synthetic amines, which are also found in the diet and in herbal plants, such as ephedrine and cathinone. They include amphetamine and its analogues, such as MDMA ('ecstasy'), and synthetic proprietary sympathomimetic agents such as phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine. On the vascular system they cause vasoconstriction and a rise in blood pressure. This effect is the basis of their use as nasal decongestants. For over 50 years, they have been assumed to be indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines, their responses being due to the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic neurones. There are, however, results that suggest that this is not their only mechanism of action and that they may also exert direct vascular effects independent of a noradrenergic mechanism. Recently, a group of novel trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) have been cloned and identified in the brain and peripheral tissues including blood vessels. Trace amines bind to these cloned receptors and it is suggested that their vasoconstrictor effects can in part be attributed to this mechanism. This review describes the cardiovascular pharmacology of this diverse group of amines, their structures and uses and their endogenous synthesis and metabolism. The review also considers their clinical relevance as constituents of the diet, as therapeutic agents (ritodrine, phenylpropanolamine, and pseudoephedrine) and as drugs of abuse (amphetamine, 'ecstasy') and their mechanisms of action.

Thyroid hormones binding to alpha v beta 3 integrin produced growth-promoting activities in ovarian cancer and we hypothesized that natural thyroid hormone derivatives may antagonize these actions. The effect of three antagonists, tetraiodoacetic acid (tetrac), triiodothyroacetic acid (triac) and 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), on cell proliferation, cell death and DNA damage was studied in two ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3 and A2780), normal hamster ovary control cells (CHOK1) and alpha n beta 3-deficient or transfected HEK293 cells. A differential inhibition of cell proliferation was observed in ovarian cancer cells compared to CHOK1. In OVCAR3, an induction of cell cycle regulators was further shown. Apoptosis was confirmed (annexin-PI, SubG1/cell-cycle, apoptotic genes, caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavage) and was reversed by a pan-caspase inhibitor. Induction in apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) was observed, suggesting a parallel caspase-independent mechanism. Integrin-involvement in triac/T1AM apoptotic action was shown in alpha v beta 3-transfected HEK293 cells. Lastly, in ovarian cancer models, key proteins that coordinate recognition of DNA damage, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and PARP-1, were induced.

1019090,Toxicology of choroid plexus: Special reference to metal-induced neurotoxicities,"The chemical stability in the brain underlies normal human thinking, learning, and behavior. Compelling evidence demonstrates a definite capacity of the choroid plexus in sequestering toxic heavy metal and metalloid ions. As the integrity of blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers, both structurally and functionally, is essential to brain chemical stability, the role of the choroid plexus in metal-induced neurotoxicities has become an important, yet under-investigated research area in neurotoxicology. Metals acting on the choroid plexus can be categorized into three major groups. A general choroid plexus toxicant can directly damage the choroid plexus structure such as mercury and cadmium. A selective choroid plexus toxicant may impair specific plexus regulatory pathways that are critical to brain development and function, rather than induce massive pathological alteration. The typical examples in this category include lead-induced alteration in transthyretin production and secretion as well as manganese interaction with iron in the choroid plexus. Furthermore, a sequestered choroid plexus toxicant, such as iron, silver, or gold, may be sequestered by the choroid plexus as an essential CNS defense mechanism. Our current knowledge on the toxicological aspect of choroid plexus research is still incomplete. Thus, the future research needs have been suggested to focus on the role of choroid plexus in early CNS development as affected by metal sequestration in this tissue, to explore how metal accumulation alters the capacity of the choroid plexus in regulation of certain essential elements involved in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and to better understand the blood-CSF barrier as a defense mechanism in overall CNS function.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

However, in 2011 it was discovered that CRYM is also an enzyme, namely ketimine reductase (KR), which catalyzes the NAD(P) H-dependent reduction of -C=N- (imine) double bonds of a number of cyclic ketimine substrates including sulfur-containing cyclic ketimines. The enzyme activity was also shown to be potently inhibited by thyroid hormones, thus suggesting a novel reciprocal relationship between enzyme catalysis and thyroid hormone bioavailability. KR is involved in a number of amino acid metabolic pathways. However, the best documented biological function of KR is its role as a Delta(1)-piperideine-2-carboxylate (P2C) reductase in the pipecolate pathway of lysine metabolism. The pipecolate pathway is the main l-lysine degradation pathway in the adult brain, whereas the saccharopine pathway predominates in extracerebral tissues and in infant brain, suggesting that KR has evolved to perform specific and important roles in neural development and function. The potent regulation of KR activity by thyroid hormones adds further weight to this suggestion. KR is also involved in L-ornithine/L-glutamate/L-proline metabolism as well as sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism. This review describes the pipecolate pathway and recent discoveries related to mammalian KR function, which have important implications in normal and pathological brain functions.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
8608350,In Vitro Studies to Define the Cell-Surface and Intracellular Targets of Polyarginine-Conjugated Sodium Borocaptate as a Potential Delivery Agent for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy,"Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) requires pharmaceutical innovations and molecular-based evidence of effectiveness to become a standard cancer therapeutic in the future. Recently, in Japan, 4-borono-L-phenylalanine (BPA) was approved as a boron agent for BNCT against head and neck (H&N) cancers. H&N cancer appears to be a suitable target for BPA-BNCT, because the expression levels of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), one of the amino acid transporters responsible for BPA uptake, are elevated in most cases of H&N cancer. However, in other types of cancer including malignant brain tumors, LAT1 is not always highly expressed. To expand the possibility of BNCT for these cases, we previously developed poly-arginine peptide (polyR)-conjugated mercaptoundecahydrododecaborate (BSH). PolyR confers the cell membrane permeability and tumor selectivity of BSH. However, the molecular determinants for the properties are not fully understood. In this present study, we have identified the cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) protein and translational machinery proteins as a major cell surface target and intracellular targets of BSH-polyR, respectively. CD44, also known as a stem cell-associated maker in various types of cancer, is required for the cellular uptake of polyR-conjugated molecules. We showed that BSH-polyR was predominantly delivered to a CD44High cell population of cancer cells. Once delivered, BSH-polyR interacted with the translational machinery components, including the initiation factors, termination factors, and poly(A)-biding protein (PABP). As a proof of principle, we performed BSH-polyR-based BNCT against glioma stem-like cells and revealed that BSH-polyR successfully induced BNCT-dependent cell death specifically in CD44High cells. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that BSH-polyR would be suitable for certain types of malignant tumors. Our results shed light on the biochemical properties of BSH-polyR, which may further contribute to the therapeutic optimization of BSH-BNCT in the future.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8632158,Polymodal roles of transient receptor potential channels in the control of ocular function,"Maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ levels at orders of magnitude below those in the extracellular environment is a requisite for preserving cell viability. Membrane channels contribute to such control through modulating their time-dependent opening and closing behaviour. Such regulation requires Ca2+ to serve as a second messenger mediating receptor control of numerous life-sustaining responses. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels signal transduce a wide variety of different sensory stimuli to induce responses modulating cellular function. These channels are non-selective cation channels with variable Ca2+ selectivity having extensive sequence homology. They constitute a superfamily made up of 28 different members that are subdivided into 7 different subfamilies based on differences in sequence homology. Some of these TRP channel isotypes are expressed in the eye and localized to both neuronal and non-neuronal cell membranes. Their activation generates intracellular Ca2+ transients and other downstream-linked signalling events that affect numerous responses required for visual function. As there is an association between changes in functional TRP expression in various ocular diseases, there are efforts underway to determine if these channels can be used as drug targets to reverse declines in ocular function. We review here our current knowledge about the expression, function and regulation of TRPs in different eye tissues in health and disease. Furthermore, some of the remaining hurdles are described to developing safe and efficacious TRP channel modulators for use in a clinical setting.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Four hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF-1, -3, and -4 and C/EBP) that are present in liver but not in most other adult tissues bind DNA sites in the TTR gene that are sufficient to direct transgenic expression. Three of these proteins were also found in yolk sac cells, which also express the transgene. A limited transgenic construct is not active in the choroid plexus and a TTR-producing choroid plexus tumor lacks three of the liver-enriched DNA-binding proteins. We conclude that cell-specific expression of TTR is regulated at least in part by the differential cellular distribution of positive-acting transcription factors.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Transthyretin is expressed predominantly in the liver and choroid plexus in adult mice, and TTR upstream regulatory elements were previously shown to potentiate transcription in liver-derived cells. The effects of inserting the TTR distal enhancer and/or promoter-proximal sequences into an M-MuLV LTR lacking its enhancers were measured in three ways. (i) Chimeric LTRs were fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and tested for transient gene expression by transfection into liver-derived cells or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. (ii) Infectious M-MuLV containing an altered LTR [delta Mo + TTR(PD) MuLV) was generated, and infectivity in culture on hepatocyte lines and NIH 3T3 cells was tested. (iii) Infection of delta Mo + TTR(PD) MuLV in vivo was tested by inoculating NFS/N mice and performing in situ hybridization of whole animal sections. Chimeric LTR-cat constructs showed higher levels of cat gene expression in liver-derived cell lines than in NIH 3T3 cells, indicating increased LTR activity in these cells. However, in vitro infection did not show significantly higher infectivity in hepatocytes for delta Mo + TTR(PD) M-MuLV than did wild-type M-MuLV. In vivo, delta Mo + TTR(PD) MuLV showed expression in the same tissues as with wild-type M-MuLV-inoculated mice, i.e., lymphoid organs and the intestines and, additionally, two novel sites not seen in wild-type M-MuLV-inoculated animals. Of 10 mice, 8 showed viral expression in the brain and 3 showed expression in the liver. Thus, insertion of TTR elements into the M-MuLV LTR altered LTR activity both in vitro and in vivo.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

However, exogenous H2S in combination with 17.5% oxygen is able to induce hypoxia, which in itself is a trigger of hypometabolism/ hypothermia. Using non-invasive thermographic imaging, we demonstrated that mice exposed to hypoxia (5% oxygen) reduce their body temperature to ambient temperature. In contrast, animals exposed to 80 ppm H2S under normoxic conditions did not exhibit a reduction in body temperature compared to normoxic controls. In conclusion, mice induce hypothermia in response to hypoxia but not H2S gas, which contradicts the reported findings and putative contentions.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

A cDNA encoding serum RBP was cloned from liver and 7-day larvae of the marine fish Sparus aurata. The mature protein is 176 amino acids long and shows sequence identity of 77-78%, 56%, 63% and 62% with rainbow trout, Xenopus, chicken and human RBP, respectively. Northern blot analysis of hepatic RBP revealed two transcripts: a major one of approximately 1.4-1.5 kb and a minor of approximately 0.7 kb. Distribution of RBP mRNA in various tissues was studied by RT-PCR and showed high expression in liver and skin, and low expression in brain, kidney and gill filament (20-35% of the level in liver). RBP expression in intestine, pyloric caeca, muscle and pituitary was estimated to be approximately 7-14% of the level in liver. The ontogeny of RBP expression in S. aurata was examined in unfertilized eggs, embryos and larvae by using RT-PCR followed by hybridization with a specific probe. RBP transcript was found in all larval stages studied. Very low levels of RBP mRNA were detected in unfertilized eggs and in embryos 8 h after fertilization with a gradual increase at 12 h and 15-16 h post-fertilization. A single injection of estradiol-17beta to S. aurata immature, bisexual fish or to adult males reduced steady-state levels of hepatic RBP by 37 and 25%, respectively. The same treatment induced vitellogenin expression. The present data suggest that in fish, liver is the main site of RBP synthesis, but that RBP may have an important function in fish skin.

8632156,3-iodothyronamine: a novel hormone controlling the balance between glucose and lipid utilisation,"3-Iodothyronamine is considered as a derivate of thyroid hormone as a result of enzymatic deiodination and decarboxylation. The physiological role of thyronamine (T1AM) is not known. The aim of this study was to analyze the metabolic response to T1AM in the Djungarian hamster Phodopus sungorus. We measured the influence of T1AM (50 mg/kg) on metabolic rate (VO2), body temperature (T-b) and respiratory quotient (RQ) in this species and in BL/6 mice. T1AM treated hamsters as well as the mice showed a rapid decrease in VO2 and T-b, accompanied by a reduction of RQ from normal values of about similar to 0.9 to similar to 0.70 for several hours. This indicates that carbohydrate utilisation is blocked by the injection of T1AM and that metabolic pathways are rerouted from carbohydrate to lipid utilisation in response to T1AM. This assumption was further supported by the observation that the treatment of T1AM caused ketonuria and a significant loss of body fat. Our results indicate that T1AM has the potential to control the balance between glucose and lipid utilisation in vivo.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Here, we report the development of a method to measure 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and thyronamine (T(0)AM) in plasma and tissue samples. The detection limit of the method was 0.25 nmol/l in plasma and 0.30 pmol/g in tissue both for T(1)AM and for T(0)AM. Using this method, we were able to demonstrate T(1)AM and T(0)AM in plasma and liver from rats treated with synthetic thyronamines. Although we demonstrated the in vivo conversion of C-13(6)-thyroxine (C-13(6)-T-4) to C-13(6)-3,5, 3'-triiodothyronine, we did not detect C-13(6)-T(1)AM in plasma or brain samples of rats treated with C-13(6)-T-4. Surprisingly, our method did not detect any endogenous T(1)AM or T(0)AM in plasma from vehicle-treated rats, nor in human plasma or thyroid tissue. Although we are cautious to draw general conclusions from these negative findings and in spite of the fact that insufficient sensitivity of the method related to extractability and stability of T(0)AM cannot be completely excluded at this point, our findings raise questions on the biosynthetic pathways and concentrations of endogenous T(1)AM and T(0)AM.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the multi-target effects of these novel drug candidates, here we investigated whether the modulation of SIRT6, known to play a key role in reprogramming energy metabolism, might also drive the activation of clearing pathways, such as autophagy and ubiquitine-proteasome (UP), as further mechanisms against neurodegeneration. We show that both T1AM and SG-2 increase autophagy in U87MG cells by inducing the expression of SIRT6, which suppresses Akt activity thus leading to mTOR inhibition. This effect was concomitant with down-regulation of autophagy-related genes, including Hif1α, p53 and mTOR. Remarkably, when mTOR was inhibited a concomitant activation of autophagy and UP took place in U87MG cells. Since both compounds activate autophagy, which is known to sustain long term potentiation (LTP) in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and counteracting AD pathology, further electrophysiological studies were carried out in a transgenic mouse model of AD. We found that SG-2 was able to rescue LTP with an efficacy comparable to T1AM, further underlying its potential as a novel pleiotropic agent for neurodegenerative disorders treatment.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8632155,"Thyroid hormone, thyroid hormone metabolites and mast cells: A less explored issue","Mast cells are primary players in immune and inflammatory diseases. In the brain, mast cells are located at the brain side of the blood brain barrier (BBB) exerting a crucial role in protecting the brain from xenobiotic invasion. Furthermore, recent advances in neuroscience indicate mast cells may play an important role in glial cell-neuron communication through the release of mediators, including histamine. Interestingly, brain mast cells contain not only 50% of the brain histamine but also hormones, proteases and lipids or amine mediators; and cell degranulation may be triggered by different stimuli activating membrane bound receptors including the four types of histaminergic receptors. Among hormones, mast cells can store thyroid hormone (T3) and express membrane-bound thyroid stimulating hormone receptors (TSHRs), thus suggesting from one side that thyroid function may affect mast cells function, from the other that mast cell degranulation may impact on thyroid function. In this respect, the research on hormones in mast cells is scarce. Recent pharmacological evidence indicates the existence of a non-genomic portion of the thyroid secretion including thyroid hormone metabolites. Among which the 3,5 diiodothyronine (3,5-T2), 3-iodothyroanamine (T1AM) and 3-iodothyroacetic acid (TA1) are the most studied. All these compounds are endogenously occurring and found to be increased in inflammatory-based diseases involving mast cells. T1AM and TA1 induce, as T3, neuroprotective effects and itch but also hyperalgesia in rodents with a mechanism largely unknown but mediated by the release of histamine. Due to the rapid onset of their effectiveness they may trigger histamine release from a cell where it is ""ready-to-be released,"" i.e., mast cells. Following a very thin path which passes through old experimental and clinical evidence, at the light of novel acquisitions on endogenous T3 metabolites, we aim to stimulate the attention on the possibility that mast cell histamine may be the connector of a novel (neuro) endocrine pathway linking the thyroid with mast cells.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8632154,Age-Related Resistance to Thyroid Hormone Action,"The age-related resistance to thyroid hormones (THs) explains the paucity of symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism in older adults and may partly explain the myriad of symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism in biochemically euthyroid older people. This review considers the available data on the mechanisms underlying TH resistance with aging and compares these physiologic changes with the changes observed in congenital TH resistance syndromes. Aging is associated with alterations in TH economy along with a host of changes in the responsiveness of various tissues to THs. The age-related resistance to THs can be attributed to decreased TH transport to tissues, decreased nuclear receptor occupancy, decreased activation of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, and alterations in TH responsive gene expression. Although an increase in serum TH levels is expected in syndromes of TH resistance, unchanged serum TH levels in the euthyroid elderly is the result of increased sensitivity to TH negative feedback with increased suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone, decreased thyroidal sensitivity to thyroid-stimulating hormone, and decreased TH production and secretion. The current clinical evidence suggests that the age-related TH resistance is mostly an adaptive response of the aging organism. It is tempting to speculate that similar changes can occur prematurely in a group of younger people who present with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism despite normal serum thyroid function tests.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
8627716,New insights into the potential roles of 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) and newly developed thyronamine-like TAAR1 agonists in neuroprotection,"3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM) is an endogenous high-affinity ligand of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), detected in mammals in many organs, including the brain. Recent evidence indicates that pharmacological TAAR1 activation may offer a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of a wide range of neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders. To assess potential neuroprotection by TAAR1 agonists, in the present work, we initially investigated whether T1AM and its corresponding 3-methylbiaryl-methane analog SG-2 can improve learning and memory when systemically administered to mice at submicromolar doses, and whether these effects are modified under conditions of MAO inhibition by clorgyline. Our results revealed that when i.p. injected to mice, both T1AM and SG-2 produced memory-enhancing and hyperalgesic effects, while increasing ERK1/2 phosphorylation and expression of transcription factor c-fos. Notably, both compounds appeared to rely on the action of ubiquitous enzymes MAO to produce the corresponding oxidative metabolites that were then able to activate the histaminergic system. Since autophagy is key for neuronal plasticity, in a second line of experiments we explored whether T1AM and synthetic TAAR1 agonists SG1 and SG2 were able to induce autophagy in human glioblastoma cell lines (U-87MG). After treatment of U-87MG cells with 1 μM T1AM, SG-1, SG-2 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunofluorescence (IF) showed a significant time-dependent increase of autophagy vacuoles and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Consistently, Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase of the LC3II/LC3I ratio, with T1AM and SG-1 being the most effective agents. A decreased level of the p62 protein was also observed after treatment with T1AM and SG-1, which confirms the efficacy of these compounds as autophagy inducers in U-87MG cells. In the process to dissect which pathway induces ATG, the effects of these compounds were evaluated on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. We found that 1 μM T1AM, SG-1 and SG-2 decreased pAKT/AKT ratio at 0.5 and 4 h after treatment, suggesting that autophagy is induced by inhibiting mTOR phosphorylation by PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. In conclusion, our study shows that T1AM and thyronamine-like derivatives SG-1 and SG-2 might represent valuable tools to therapeutically intervene with neurological disorders.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

8632147,The trace aminergic system: a gender-sensitive therapeutic target for IBS?,"Due to a lack of specific or sensitive biomarkers, drug discovery advances have been limited for individuals suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While current therapies provide symptomatic relief, inflammation itself is relatively neglected, despite the presence of chronic immune activation and innate immune system dysfunction. Moreover, considering the microgenderome concept, gender is a significant aetiological risk factor. We believe that we have pinpointed a ""missing link"" that connects gender, dysbiosis, diet, and inflammation in the context of IBS, which may be manipulated as therapeutic target. The trace aminergic system is conveniently positioned at the interface of the gut microbiome, dietary nutrients and by-products, and mucosal immunity. Almost all leukocyte populations express trace amine associated receptors and significant amounts of trace amines originate from both food and the gut microbiota. Additionally, although IBS-specific data are sparse, existing data supports an interpretation in favour of a gender dependence in trace aminergic signalling. As such, trace aminergic signalling may be altered by fluctuations of especially female reproductive hormones. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, this review discusses potential mechanisms of actions, which include hyperreactivity of the immune system and aberrant serotonin signalling, and links outcomes to the symptomology clinically prevalent in IBS. Taken together, it is feasible that the additional level of regulation by the trace aminergic system in IBS has been overlooked, until now.

TH signaling modulates energy expenditure through both central and peripheral pathways. At the cellular level, the TH exerts its effects after concerted mechanisms facilitate binding to the TH receptor. In the hypothalamus, signals from a range of metabolic pathways, including appetite, temperature, afferent stimuli via the autonomic nervous system, availability of energy substrates, hormones, and other biologically active molecules, converge to maintain plasma TH at the appropriate level to preserve energy homeostasis. At the tissue level, TH actions on metabolism are controlled by transmembrane transporters, deiodinases, and TH receptors.

8632152,TAAR1 and Psychostimulant Addiction,"Trace amine-associated receptor 1 is one of the best-characterized receptors of trace amines. Growing evidence shows that TAAR1 negatively regulates the monoaminergic activity, including dopamine transmission in the mesocorticolimbic system. Neurochemical assays demonstrated that selective TAAR1 full and partial agonists were effective to prevent psychostimulants-induced dopamine transmission in vitro and in vivo. In the last decade, many preclinical models of psychostimulant addiction such as drug-induced behavioral sensitization, drug-induced conditioned place preference, drug self-administration, drug discrimination, and relapse models were used to assess the effects of TAAR1 agonists on psychostimulants' behavioral effects. In general, activation of TAAR1 attenuated while knockout of TAAR1 potentiated psychostimulant abuse-related behaviors. Here, we review the advances in TAAR1 and its agonists in modulating psychostimulant addiction. We discuss the similarities and differences between the neurochemical and behavioral effects of TAAR1 full and partial agonists. We also discuss several concerns including the abuse liability, sleep reduction, and species-dependent effects that might affect the successful translation of TAAR1 agonists from preclinical studies to clinical application.

T(1)AM has significant physiological effects in mammals and produces a reversible, dose-dependent negative inotropic and chronotropic effect in heart. The aim of the present study was to investigate if T(1)AM is able to reduce irreversible tissue injury in isolated rat hearts subjected to ischemia and reperfusion, as evaluated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. We observed that T(1)AM reduced infarct size at concentrations (125 nM to 12.5 mu M) which did not produce any significant hemodynamic action. The dose-response curve was bell-shaped and peaked at 1.25 mu M. T(1)AM-induced cardioprotection was completely reversed by the administration of chelerythrine and glibenclamide, suggesting a protein kinase C and K (ATP) (+) -dependent pathway, while it was not additive to the protection induced by cyclosporine A, suggesting modulation of mitochondrial permeability transition. At cardioprotective concentration, T(1)AM reduced the time needed for cardiac attest during ischemia, but it did not affect sarcoplasmatic reticulum Ca(2+) handling, as demonstrated by unaltered ryanodine receptor binding properties. In conclusion, in isolated rat heart T(1)AM produces a cardioprotective effect which is mediated by a protein kinase C and K (ATP) (+) -dependent pathway and is probably linked to modulation of mitochondrial permeability transition and/or ischemic arrest time.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8632150,Transmitters and Peptides: Basic Principles,"Signaling between cells plays an important role in all multicellular organisms, both in the nervous system as well as other tissues. Most intercellular signaling involves chemical mediators such as neurotransmitters and neuropeptides; these are collectively referred to as chemical transmitters. A large number of drugs affect cell-cell signaling, and an understanding of these signaling molecules is therefore an essential aspect of neuropharmacology. Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides share a number of key properties. Both types of chemical transmitters are synthesized and secreted from the signaling cell. The synthesis and/or secretion of the molecules is highly regulated. Another common feature of chemical transmitters is that the molecules produce a physiological response, often mediated by binding to a receptor on the cell surface. Finally, the response is terminated by removal of the signaling molecule from the extracellular space, either by chemical transformation of the neurotransmitter or neuropeptide into an inactive form or by uptake of the neurotransmitter into a cell. These general properties are shared by classical neurotransmitters (such as acetylcholine and dopamine), nonclassical neurotransmitters (such as nitric oxide and the endocannabinoids), and neuropeptides (such as enkephalin and neuropeptide Y). However, fundamental differences exist between these various classes of signaling molecules, and collectively, these distinct chemical transmitters contribute to the diversity of signaling within brain and other organs.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

By performing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we have shown that TTR inhibits Aβ oligomerization and that addition of tafamidis or its amide derivative does not affect TTR's ability to inhibit Aβ oligomerization.

Covering all common amino acids, Heteromeric Amino acid Transporters (HATs) are one class of such transporters. This review first highlights structural and functional studies that solved the atomic structure of HATs and revealed molecular clues on substrate interaction. Moreover, this review focuses on HATs that have a role in the central nervous system (CNS) and that are related to neurological diseases, including: (i) LAT1/CD98hc and its role in the uptake of branched chain amino acids trough the blood brain barrier and autism. (ii) LAT2/CD98hc and its potential role in the transport of glutamine between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.

Despite many efforts, the histogenesis of stromal cells is still unknown. We took a new approach to clarify the origin of stromal cells using immunohistochemical methods. Paraffin-embedded tissue of 24 surgically removed hemangioblastomas of the CNS was examined with antibodies against transthyretin, transferrin, vimentin, NSE, protein S-100, CK 8, KL-1, EMA, CD34, factor VIII rAg, and collagen IV. Stromal cells showed a positive reaction with anti-transthyretin in 12 of 24 hemangioblastomas, a positive reaction with anti-transferrrin, to a different extent, in 13 of 24 cases, and many stromal cells expressed basal membrane collagen IV on the cell surface in 19 of 24 cases. The expression of transthyretin and transferrin in stromal cells of hemangioblastomas is reported for the first time, thus providing an antigenic profile of hemangioblastoma stromal cells that is very similar to that of immature choroid plexus epithelium. These findings support the notion that hemangioblastoma stromal cells may originate from the embryonal plexus epithelium.

8601360,Disease biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with first-onset psychosis,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Psychosis is a severe mental condition that is characterized by a loss of contact with reality and is typically associated with hallucinations and delusional beliefs. There are numerous psychiatric conditions that present with psychotic symptoms, most importantly schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, and some forms of severe depression referred to as psychotic depression. The pathological mechanisms resulting in psychotic symptoms are not understood, nor is it understood whether the various psychotic illnesses are the result of similar biochemical disturbances. The identification of biological markers (so-called biomarkers) of psychosis is a fundamental step towards a better understanding of the pathogenesis of psychosis and holds the potential for more objective testing methods.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND FINDINGS: </strong>Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry was employed to profile proteins and peptides in a total of 179 cerebrospinal fluid samples (58 schizophrenia patients, 16 patients with depression, five patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, ten patients with Alzheimer disease, and 90 controls). Our results show a highly significant differential distribution of samples from healthy volunteers away from drug-naïve patients with first-onset paranoid schizophrenia. The key alterations were the up-regulation of a 40-amino acid VGF-derived peptide, the down-regulation of transthyretin at approximately 4 kDa, and a peptide cluster at approximately 6,800-7,300 Da (which is likely to be influenced by the doubly charged ions of the transthyretin protein cluster). These schizophrenia-specific protein/peptide changes were replicated in an independent sample set. Both experiments achieved a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 80% or 88% in the initial study and in a subsequent validation study, respectively.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Our results suggest that the application of modern proteomics techniques, particularly mass spectrometric approaches, holds the potential to advance the understanding of the biochemical basis of psychiatric disorders and may in turn allow for the development of diagnostics and improved therapeutics. Further studies are required to validate the clinical effectiveness and disease specificity of the identified biomarkers.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8601311,Cardiac phenotype and clinical outcome of familial amyloid polyneuropathy associated with transthyretin alanine 60 variant,"<strong>AIMS: </strong>Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is a dominantly inherited multi-system disease associated with transthyretin (TTR) mutations. Previous series have predominantly described patients with the TTR variant Val30Met (V30M), which is the most prevalent cause of FAP worldwide. Here, we report the dominant cardiac phenotype and outcome of FAP associated with TTR Thr60Ala (T60A), the most common UK variant.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>Sixty consecutive patients with FAP associated with TTR T60A (FAP T60A) were prospectively evaluated in two centres between 1992 and 2009. Median (range) age of symptom development was 63 (45-78) years. A family history of amyloidosis was present in only 37%. Autonomic and peripheral neuropathy were present in 44 and 32 patients, respectively, at diagnosis. Cardiac involvement was evident on echocardiography at diagnosis in 56 patients, but was associated with reduced QRS voltages on electrocardiography in only 16% evaluable cases. Seventeen patients received implantable anti-arrhythmic devices. Median survival was 6.6 years following onset of symptoms and 3.4 years from diagnosis, and correlated with serum N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration and certain echocardiographic parameters at the latter. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), performed to eliminate the predominant hepatic source of variant TTR T60A protein, was performed in eight patients including one who received a concomitant cardiac transplant. Cardiac amyloidosis progressed in all lone OLT recipients, of whom four died within 5 years.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Cardiac amyloidosis is almost always present at diagnosis in FAP T60A, and is a major determinant of its poor prognosis.

So far, no case with FAP from Mainland China was reported with a heterozygous missense mutation c.349G>T in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene. We report a 58-year-old man presenting with progressive peripheral neuropathy, autonomic failure and chronic paroxysmal dry cough. His father, three elder brothers and an elder sister suffered from the similar symptoms. Diagnostic whole-exome sequencing revealed a proven heterozygous missense mutation c.349G>T in exon 4 of the TTR gene, resulting in replacement of alanine with serine at position 117 of the mature protein (Ala117Ser).

8601118,Exchange-mode glutamine transport across CNS cell membranes,"CNS cell membranes possess four transporters capable of exchanging Lglutamine (Gln) for other amino acids: the large neutral amino acid (LNAA) transporters LAT1 and LAT2, the hybrid basic amino acid (L-arginine (Arg), L-leucine (Leu)/LNAA transporter y+LAT2, and the L-alanine/L-serine/L-cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2). LAT1/LAT2 and y+LAT2 are present in astrocytes, neurons and the blood brain barrier (BBB) - forming cerebral vascular endothelial cells (CVEC), while the location of ASCT2 in the individual cell types is a matter of debate. In the healthy brain, contribution of the exchangers to Gln shuttling from astrocytes to neurons and thus their role in controlling the conversion of Gln to the amino acid neurotransmitters l-glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Gln flux across the BBB appears negligible as compared to the system A and system N uniporters. Insofar, except for the contribution of LAT1 to the maintenance of Gln homeostasis in the interstitial fluid (ISF), no well-defined CNS-specific function has been established for either of the three transporters in the healthy brain. The Gln-accepting amino acid exchangers appear to gain significance under conditions of excessive brain Gln load (glutaminosis). Excess Gln efflux across the BBB enhances influx into the brain of L-tryptophan (Trp). Excess of Trp is responsible for overloading the brain with neuroactive compounds: serotonin, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid and/or oxindole, which contribute to neurotransmission imbalance accompanying hyperammonemia. In turn, alterations of y+LAT2-mediated Gln/Arg exchange and Arg uptake in astrocyte, modulate astrocytic nitric oxide synthesis and oxidative/nitrosative stress in ammonia-overexposed brain.

Surprisingly, histopathologic analysis demonstrated central nervous system toxoplasmosis with pronounced inflammatory reaction (reactive astrogliosis, microglia activation, macrophage, and T-lymphocyte infiltration), which was associated with strong LAT1/LAT2/CD98 expression.

The obtained single cells were cultured in DMEM with 1% epidermal growth factor and 20% fetal calf serum. Five days later, immunohistochemistry with anti-transthyretin antibody was used to identify the purity of cultured cells. The well-grown cells were treated with aluminum lactate at different concentrations (0, 100, 400, and 1 600 μmol/L for control, lowdose, mediumdose, and highdose groups). Fortyeight hours later, the cell viability, apoptotic rate, level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD)were measured in each group to evaluate the impairment in primary cultured rat CPECs by aluminum.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>More than 95% of the cultured cells were identified as CPECs.

8601165,Renalase regulates peripheral and central dopaminergic activities,"Renalase is a recently identified FAD/NADH-dependent amine oxidase mainly expressed in kidney that is secreted into blood and urine where it was suggested to metabolize catecholamines. The present study evaluated central and peripheral dopaminergic activities in the renalase knockout (KO) mouse model and examined the changes induced by recombinant renalase (RR) administration on plasma and urine catecholamine levels. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, KO mice presented increased plasma levels of epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) that were accompanied by increases in the urinary excretion of Epi, NE, DA. In addition, the KO mice presented an increase in urinary DA-to-l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) ratios without changes in renal tubular aromatic-l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) activity. By contrast, the in vivo administration of RR (1.5 mg/kg sc) to KO mice was accompanied by significant decreases in plasma levels of Epi, DA, and l-DOPA as well as in urinary excretion of Epi, DA, and DA-to-l-DOPA ratios notwithstanding the accompanied increase in renal AADC activity. In addition, the increase in renal DA output observed in renalase KO mice was accompanied by an increase in the expression of the L-type amino acid transporter like (LAT) 1 that is reversed by the administration of RR in these animals. These results suggest that the overexpression of LAT1 in the renal cortex of the renalase KO mice might contribute to the enhanced l-DOPA availability/uptake and consequently to the activation of the renal dopaminergic system in the presence of renalase deficiency.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8632165,Central effects of 3-Iodothyronamine Reveal a novel Role for Mitochondrial Monoamine Oxidases,"3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM) is the last iodinated thyronamine generated from thyroid hormone alternative metabolism found circulating in rodents and in humans. So far, the physiopathological meaning of T1AM tissue levels is unknown. Much is instead known on T1AM pharmacological effects in rodents. Such evidence indicates that T1AM acutely modifies, with high potency and effectiveness, rodents' metabolism and behavior, often showing inverted U-shaped dose-response curves. Although several possible targets for T1AM were identified, the mechanism underlying T1AM behavioral effects remains still elusive. T1AM pharmacokinetic features clearly indicate the central nervous system is not a preferential site for T1AM distribution but it is a site where T1AM levels are critically regulated, as it occurs for neuromodulators or neurotransmitters. We here summarize and discuss evidence supporting the hypothesis that central effects of T1AM derive from activation of intracellular and possibly extracellular pathways. In this respect, consisting evidence indicates the intracellular pathway is mediated by the product of T1AM phase-I non-microsomal oxidation, the 3-iodothryoacetic acid, while other data indicate a role for the trace amine-associated receptor, isoform 1, as membrane target of T1AM (extracellular pathway). Overall, these evidence might sustain the non-linear dose-effect curves typically observed when increasing T1AM doses are administered and reveal an interesting and yet unexplored link between thyroid, monoamine oxidases activity and histamine.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

Amyloid β protein (Aβ), immunoglobulin light chains, cystatin C, prion protein (PrP), ABri/ADan, transthyretin, and gelsoline, are all associated with CAA. While most CAA patients demonstrated sporadic Aβ-type amyloid deposition, a small number of patients present with familial forms, e.g. Dutch-type hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (HCHWA-D), Icelandic-type HCHWA (HCHWA-I), familial British dementia (FBD), familial Danish dementia (FDD), and PrP-CAA. Deposited amyloid proteins damage smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls leading to pathological appearances calling 'double-barreled' changes, fibrinoid necrosis, and microaneurysms. These structural abnormalities result in microinfarcts and hemorrhages in the central nervous system. Recurrent hemorrhage is a common clinical manifestation in patients with CAA; however, small multiple infarctions, progressive dementia, transient neurological symptoms, and CAA-related inflammation can also occur.

8608384,Release from live choroid plexus of apical fragments and electrophoretic characterization of their synthetic products,"Protein synthesis and secretion by the choroid plexus (CP) has been implicated as a major source of certain proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as transthyretin. The suggestion that proteins are elaborated from CP through apocrine secretion has been borne out by the presence of newly labeled proteins in apical protrusions from CP (Agnew et al.: Cell and Tissue Research 208:261-281, 1980a). When the protrusions (aposomes) separate from the cells, they continue to incorporate labeled amino acids (Gudeman et al.: Tissue and Cell 19:101-109, 1987). In the present work the formation of aposomes in live CP explants indicated that these spheroids were not the result of fixation. Aposomes were also identified within rat CSF by immunohistochemistry with monoclonal directed against aposomes as well as with anti-transthyretin serum. The protein product of aposomes was characterized by 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE and compared to the protein products of whole CP tissue. Paradoxically, transthyretin, a heavily labeled protein in the tissue, was virtually undetected in the aposome synthetic profile. However, four other proteins were expressed in relatively equivalent amounts by the aposomes. The presence of mRNA in aposomes was detected with a poly dT probe, and the presence of actin was revealed by phalloidin staining of aposomes.

Previously, SSA was thought to represent a disease of aged patients over 80 years only; however, recent studies have indicated that SSA also affects much younger patients, with an onset around 50 years. In addition, a number of patients with SSA present with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), often several years prior to the onset of heart failure. Hence, CTS may be a key symptom suggestive of SSA, and amyloid deposits should always be confirmed in the operation specimens obtained during carpal tunnel release surgery in CTS patients aged over 50 years.

The changing patterns of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) transporters, receptors, and tight junction/adherence junction-related proteins were classified into 4 types: uphill (continuously increasing expression from postnatal day (P) 1 to P56), bell-shape/inverted bell-shape (increased/decreased expression from P1 to P14 followed by decreased/increased expression from P21 to P56), downhill (continuously decreasing expression from P1 to P56), and constant (no significant difference from P1 to P56). Proteins showing uphill-type expression included P-glycoprotein/Mdr1a/Abcb1, Mrp4/Abcc4, Bcrp/Abcg2, Glut1/Slc2a1, Oatp1c1/Slco1c1, FcRn, 4F2hc/Slc3a2, claudin-5, caveolin-1, Cd29/integrin β1. Those showing bell-shape/inverted bell-shape expression included Mct1/Slc16a1, Oat3/Slc22a8, Tfr1, Lrp1, and CD147. On the other hand, Cat1/Slc7a1 and Cd54/Icam-1 showed downhill expression, and Insr showed constant expression. These results suggest that the protein expression levels of transporters and receptors at the BBB change in various ways to meet the changing requirements of the developing brain.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8601180,Anti-thyroid antibodies and thyroid function in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are complicated neuroautoimmune disorders which can coexist with other organ-specific autoimmune disorders. The most frequently specific organ is the thyroid. The aim of this study is to evaluate the thyroid function of NMOSD patients and detect the difference between anti-thyroid antibodies (ATAbs) seropositive and seronegative NMOSD patients.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>88 patients diagnosed with NMOSD were enrolled and their thyroid functions were evaluated. They were divided into two groups by ATAbs abnormalities. In addition, demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms and MRI scan results of brain and spinal cord were assessed.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAbs) seropositivities were detected more frequently in patients with NMOSDs when compared with healthy controls (37.5% vs 14.9%, P=0.01, Diff22.6%, 95CI[9.0%, 34.9%]; 31.8% vs 16.2%, P=0.022, Diff15.6%, 95CI[2.27%, 27.9%]). In NMOSD patients, the Expanded disability status scale score (EDSS) score was significantly higher in ATAbs seropositive group than that in ATAbs seronegative group (median 6.5 vs 3.75, P=0.012). However, there is no significant difference for demographic characteristics and other clinical symptoms. Moreover, NMOSD patients with ATAbs abnormalities had more brain and cervical cord lesions when compared with ATAbs negative NMOSD patients (83.8% vs 61.4%, P=0.029, Diff22.4%, 95CI[0.9%, 40.9%]; 93.9% vs 59.6%, P=0.001, Diff34.3%, 95CI[13.6%, 50.4%]).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>NMOSD patients have a higher frequency of ATAbs abnormalities.

8627712,"Design, synthesis, and evaluation of thyronamine analogues as novel potent mouse trace amine associated receptor 1 (mTAAR1) agonists","Trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in brain and periphery activated by a wide spectrum of agonists that include, but are not limited to, trace amines (TAs), amphetamine-like psychostimulants, and endogenous thyronamines such as thyronamine (T0AM) and 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM). Such polypharmacology has made it challenging to understand the role and the biology of TAAR1. In an effort to understand the molecular basis of TAAR1 activation, we rationally designed and synthesized a small family of thyronamine derivatives. Among them, compounds 2 and 3 appeared to be a good mimic of the parent endogenous thyronamine, T0AM and T1AM, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, these compounds offer suitable tools for studying the physiological roles of mouse TAAR1 and could represent the starting point for the development of more potent and selective TAAR1 ligands.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The amino acid transporter LAT1 and its cofactor CD98, which are involved in AA uptake, have never been investigated in BM. The aim of our study was to determine and compare the expression of LAT1 and CD98 in BM and in non-tumoral brain tissue (NT). The expression of LAT1 and CD98 were studied by immunohistochemistry in 67 BM, including 18 BM recurrences after radiotherapy, in 53 NT, and in 13 cases of patients with previously irradiated brain tumor and investigated by [18F] FDOPA-PET. LAT1 and CD98 expression were detected in 98.5% and 59.7% of BM respectively and were significantly associated with BM tissue as compared to NT (p<0.001). LAT1 expression in recurrent BM was significantly increased as compared to newly occurring BM. Ten cases investigated by [18F] FDOPA-PET corresponding to recurrent BM displayed significant [18F] FDOPA uptake and LAT1 overexpression whereas three cases corresponding to radionecrosis showed no or low uptake and LAT1 expression. LAT1 expression level and [18F] FDOPA uptake were significantly correlated. In conclusion, we hypothesized that BM may overexpress the AA transporter LAT1. We have shown that LAT1 overexpression was common in BM and was specific for BM as compared to healthy brain. These results could explain the specific BM uptake on PET-AA.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

8608356,Type I familial amyloid polyneuropathy. A pathological study of the peripheral nervous system,"The neuropathological changes were examined in 2 cases of type I familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), confirmed by a genetic study with human transthyretin (prealbumin) cDNA. These cases were from different foci of type I FAP in Japan, but showed a similar pathology in the peripheral nerves. Loss of dorsal root and sympathetic ganglion neurons, predominantly those of small size, was prominent, whereas ventral horn cells were well preserved. Distally accentuated axonal loss with marked axonal sprouting was the principal feature. Fibre sprouts were ubiquitous throughout the nerves and affected the fibre size distribution. Segmental demyelination and remyelination were prominent in the proximal portions of nerves, but axonal degeneration was more conspicuous in the distal portions. The centrally-directed branches of the primary sensory neurons did not show distally-accentuated axonal loss in the dorsal columns. Amyloid deposits were present universally in the endoneurial spaces of the peripheral nerves, but more prominently in the dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic ganglia and more proximal portions of the nerves, and the distribution correlated well with the occurrence of the pathology of peripheral nerves. Neurofilamentous accumulation was frequent in the proximal axons and neuronal cell bodies of the sensory and sympathetic neurons. Schwann cells and satellite cells to which amyloid deposits were attached frequently showed disappearance of basement membrane and proliferation of distorted processes. The findings in the present cases suggest that the Schwann and satellite cells may be directly affected by the amyloid deposits, but the pathogenetic mechanism of marked axonal and neuronal involvement still remains to be elucidated.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8601189,A possible role for CSF turnover and choroid plexus in the pathogenesis of late onset Alzheimer's disease,"According to the amyloid theory, the appearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits represents a pivotal event in late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Physiologically, Aβ42 monomers are cleaned by capillary resorption, enzymatic catabolism, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport. Factors that promote the oligomerization of Aβ42 must be specified. In vitro, these monomers spontaneously form neurotoxic oligomers whose rate increases with time suggesting that the stasis of CSF favors the oligomerization. In animals, experimental hydrocephalus generates CSF stasis followed by the appearance of amyloid deposits. In normal pressure hydrocephalus, amyloid deposits are common, especially in elderly patients, and the turnover decline has the same order of magnitude as in AD. In this disease, the effects of CSF stasis are potentiated by the decline in the ability of CSF to inhibit the formation of oligomers. CSF originates from choroid plexus (CP). In LOAD, the functions of secretion, synthesis, and transport of CP are impaired and this is related to morphological modifications. These impairments favor the decrease of CSF turnover, the diminished levels of transthyretin, a sequestering protein synthesized by CP, and the oligomerization of Aβ42. They are potentiated by a reduced enzymatic catabolism and a decreased capillary reabsorption of Aβ42, both alterations being related to age.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8601220,Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics for differentiating between transthyretin-related and light-chain cardiac amyloidoses,"Differential diagnosis between transthyretin (TTR) and immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) cardiac amyloidoses is essential due to significantly different prognoses and therapeutic options. Therefore, clinical characteristics of patients with biopsy-proven cardiac amyloidosis were investigated to differentiate TTR from AL amyloidosis. From September 2006 to May 2014, 46 patients were confirmed to have cardiac amyloidosis (TTR, n = 28; AL, n = 18) in our institute. The median age of patients with TTR amyloidosis was 78 years (range 61-90) with 27 (96 %) males, while that of patients with AL amyloidosis was 66 (range 52-76) with 12 (67 %) males. There were no statistically significant differences in echocardiographic findings regarding left ventricular (LV) systolic function or diastolic dysfunction between the two groups. Interestingly, serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in patients with AL amyloidosis were significantly higher than those in TTR amyloidosis patients. In contrast, the LV wall was significantly thicker in patients with TTR amyloidosis than in those with AL amyloidosis. Therefore, the ratio of BNP to LV mass index (LVMI) at presentation in AL amyloidosis patients was significantly higher than that in TTR patients (6.7 vs 2.9, p = 0.0006). A BNP-LVMI ratio of less than 3.5 had a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for TTR amyloidosis of 71 and 83 %, respectively. One-year overall survival was 88.7 % in the patients with TTR amyloidosis and 23.7 % in the patients with AL amyloidosis. Our analysis indicates that the BNP-LVMI ratio, as well as age and sex, may be useful parameters for distinguishing TTR from AL cardiac amyloidosis.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Unlike other forms of hereditary amyloidosis, this rare type displays amyloid deposition predominantly in the eyes and central nervous system. Our patient belongs to 1 of only 2 kindreds known to carry this transthyretin mutation. Previous reports focused on examination of the brain and spinal cord, largely ignoring postmortem examination of the eyes. In this case, autopsy examination revealed amyloid deposition in the leptomeninges surrounding the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Subependymal amyloid deposits projecting into the lateral ventricles as well as amyloid deposition in the choroid plexus, retinal vessels, nerve fiber layer of the retina, and vitreous were observed. Amyloid was not identified elsewhere in the body. Awareness of this rare form of hereditary amyloidosis is crucial, given the substantial genetic and therapeutic implications of the diagnosis.

8601227,Transcriptome analysis of Inbred Long Sleep and Inbred Short Sleep mice,"Many studies have utilized the Inbred Long Sleep and Inbred Short Sleep mouse strains to model the genetic influence on initial sensitivity to ethanol. The mechanisms underlying this divergent phenotype are still not completely understood. In this study, we attempt to identify genes that are differentially expressed between these two strains and to identify baseline networks of co-expressed genes, which may provide insight regarding their phenotypic differences. We examined the whole brain and striatal transcriptomes of both strains, using next generation RNA sequencing techniques. Many genes were differentially expressed between strains, including several in chromosomal regions previously shown to influence initial sensitivity to ethanol. These results are in concordance with a similar sample of striatal transcriptomes measured using microarrays. In addition to the higher dynamic range, RNA-Seq is not hindered by high background noise or polymorphisms in probesets as with microarray technology, and we are able to analyze exome sequence of abundant genes. Furthermore, utilizing Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, we identified several modules of co-expressed genes corresponding to strain differences. Several candidate genes were identified, including protein phosphatase 1 regulatory unit 1b (Ppp1r1b), prodynorphin (Pdyn), proenkephalin (Penk), ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family member 2 (Rassf2), myosin 1d (Myo1d) and transthyretin (Ttr).

The patient presented due to bilateral floaters. The vitreous cavities of both eyes showed course, fibrilar opacities attached to the posterior lens surface with pseudopodia. There was a history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Nerve conduction studies showed upper and lower limb axonal polyneuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord, renal and cardiac function were normal. Vitreous and conjunctival biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of TTR-related amyloidosis. Genetic analysis of exon 2 of the TTR gene revealed that the patient was heterozygous for a single nucleotide substitution c.160 A>G, resulting in replacement of arginine with glycine at position 34 of the mature protein (Arg34Gly). Five years later the patient developed increasing sensory and motor neuropathy of both lower limbs, and neovascular glaucoma in one eye.

8601235,Severe maternal hypothyroidism corrected prior to the third trimester is associated with normal cognitive outcome in the offspring,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Concern about potential harmful effects of early maternal hypothyroidism (MH) on fetal brain development has led to calls for universal screening early in, or even before, pregnancy. However, evidence in humans that adverse effects are irreversible if thyroid hormone replacement is initiated after the first trimester is limited. Severe MH due to thyrotropin (TSH) receptor blocking antibodies (Abs) is associated with profound cognitive delay in the offspring if MH is untreated or inadequately treated; here, we sought to determine the outcome if treatment is given in early pregnancy.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>We identified three women who had TSH receptor blocking Ab-induced MH during pregnancy and were treated with L-thyroxine (L-T4), starting at 27 weeks, 5 weeks, and the first month of gestation. The corresponding pretreatment serum TSH levels in the two women in whom data were available were 68 and 65 mU/L, falling to 6 mU/L at 25 and 24 weeks of gestation, respectively. The third woman with MH required 0.5 mg of L-T4 to normalize her thyroid hormone levels by 4 months of gestation. Their infants were also treated with L-T4 after neonatal screening that identified congenital hypothyroidism (CH). Neuropsychological tests to assess intelligence, language, memory, and visual-motor performance were administered to these three infants at 5.4 years of age (range 5.1-6.1) and to three sibling controls at 6.8 years (range 9.1-3.0).<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Children born after MH had average or above average results on all parameters. Comparative scores of the neuropsychological tests in sibling pairs for full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) and performance IQ were variable; some scores were higher and some were lower in CH children.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Although the findings do not exclude a subtle impact of MH during early gestation on intellectual function, the normal cognitive outcome despite overt MH should provide data with which to counsel mothers who have overt hypothyroidism early in pregnancy. Aggressive thyroid hormone replacement as soon as possible is important, but early termination of the pregnancy because of fear that the baby will have significant cognitive delay is not warranted.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8601264,Understanding How the Subcommissural Organ and Other Periventricular Secretory Structures Contribute via the Cerebrospinal Fluid to Neurogenesis,"The dynamic and molecular composition of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, consequently, the CSF physiology is much more complex and fascinating than the simplistic view held for decades. Signal molecules either transported from blood to CSF or secreted into the CSF by circumventricular organs and CSF-contacting neurons, use the CSF to reach their targets in the brain, including the pre- and postnatal neurogenic niche. The subcommissural organ (SCO), a highly conserved brain gland present throughout the vertebrate phylum, is one of the sources for signals, as well as the choroid plexus, tanycytes and CSF-contacting neurons. The SCO secretes into the fetal and adult CSF SCO-spondin, transthyretin, and basic fibroblast growth factor. These proteins participate in certain aspects of neurogenesis, such as cell cycle of neural stem cells, neuronal differentiation, and axon pathfinding. Through the CSF, the SCO-secretory proteins may reach virtually any target in the embryonic and adult central nervous system. Since the SCO continues to secrete throughout life span, it seems likely that the neurogenetic property of the SCO compounds would be targeted to the niches where neurogenesis continues in adulthood. This review is aimed to bring into discussion early and new evidence concerning the role(s) of the SCO, and the probable mechanisms by which SCO compounds can readily reach the neurogenic niche of the subventricular zone flowing with the CSF to participate in the regulation of the neurogenic niche. As we unfold the multiples trans-fluid talks between discrete brain domains we will have more tools to influence such talks.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
8601265,The amyloidogenic V122I transthyretin variant in elderly black Americans,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Approximately 4% of black Americans carry a valine-to-isoleucine substitution (V122I) in the transthyretin protein, which has been associated with late-onset restrictive amyloid cardiomyopathy and increased risks of death and heart failure.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>We determined genotype status for the transthyretin gene (TTR) in 3856 black participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and assessed clinical profiles, mortality, and the risk of incident heart failure in V122I TTR variant carriers (124 participants [3%]) versus noncarriers (3732 participants). Cardiac structure and function and features suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis were assessed in participants who underwent echocardiography during visit 5 (2011 to 2013), when they were older than 65 years of age.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>After 21.5 years of follow-up, we did not detect a significant difference in mortality between carriers (41 deaths, 33%) and noncarriers (1382 deaths, 37%; age- and sex-stratified hazard ratio among carriers, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 1.36; P=0.97). The TTR variant was associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure (age- and sex-stratified hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.10; P=0.04). On echocardiography at visit 5, carriers (46 participants) had worse systolic and diastolic function, as well as a higher level of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, than noncarriers (1194 participants), although carriers had a low prevalence (7%) of overt manifestations of amyloid cardiomyopathy.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>We did not detect a significant difference in mortality between V122I TTR allele carriers and noncarriers, a finding that contrasts with prior observations; however, the risk of heart failure was increased among carriers. The prevalence of overt cardiac abnormalities among V122I TTR carriers was low.

The purpose of the present study was to determine, by means of quantitative targeted absolute proteomics, the protein expression levels in hCMEC/D3 cells of multiple transporters, receptors and junction proteins for comparison with our previously reported findings in isolated human brain microvessels. Among 91 target molecules, 12 transporters, 2 receptors, 1 junction protein and 1 membrane marker were present at quantifiable levels in plasma membrane fraction of hCMEC/D3 cells. ABCA2, MDR1, MRP4, BCRP, GLUT1, 4F2hc, MCT1, ENT1, transferrin and insulin receptors and claudin-5 were detected in both hCMEC/D3 cells and human brain microvessels. After normalization based on Na(+)/K(+) ATPase expression, the differences in protein expression levels between hCMEC/D3 cells and human brain microvessels were within 4-fold for these proteins, with the exceptions of ENT1, transferrin receptor and claudin-5. ABCA8, LAT1, LRP1 and γ-GTP were below the limit of quantification in the cells, but were found in human brain microvessels. ABCA3, ABCA6, MRP1 and ATA1 were found only in hCMEC/D3 cells. Furthermore, compared with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as reference nonbrain endothelial cells, MDR1 was found only in hCMEC/D3 cells, and GLUT1 expression was 15-fold higher in hCMEC/D3 cells than in HUVECs.

8632164,Tissue thyroid hormones and thyronamines,"It has been known for a long time that changes in cardiac function are a major component of the clinical presentation of thyroid disease. Increased heart rate and hyperdynamic circulation are hallmarks of hyperthyroidism, while bradycardia and decreased contractility characterize hypothyroidism. Recent findings have provided novel insights in the physiology and pathophysiology of heart regulation by thyroid hormones. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge on thyroxine (T-4) transport and metabolism and on the biochemical pathways leading to genomic and non-genomic effects produced by 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3) and by its active metabolites, particularly 3,5-diiodothyronine (T-2) and 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM). On this basis, specific issues of special interest for cardiology are discussed, namely (1) relevance of the regulation of proteins involved in the control of calcium homeostasis and in pacemaker cell activity, due to non-genomic as well as to classical genomic effects; (2) stimulation of fatty acid oxidation by T-2 and T(1)AM, the latter also causing a negative inotropic and chronotropic action at micromolar concentrations; (3) induction of D3 deiodinase in heart failure, potentially causing selective cardiac hypothyroidism, whose clinical implications are still controversial; and (4) cardioprotective effect of T(1)AM, possibly occurring at physiological concentrations, and relevance of T-3 and of thyroid hormone receptor alpha(1) in post-infarction repair.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

8601276,Molecular imaging of amyloidosis: will the heart be the next target after the brain?,"Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous group of diseases with a common feature of extracellular deposition and infiltration of different types of amyloid fibrils in various organs. For example, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by deposition of amyloid β in the brain. Radiolabeled positron emission tomography (PET) tracers, mainly derivatives of thioflavin-T, were recently introduced for identification of amyloid β plaques in Alzheimer's patients. Such advances of amyloid β plaque imaging of the brain may shed light into imaging of other organs in amyloidosis patients, such as the heart. Cardiac infiltration of amyloid confers poor clinical outcomes, which renders early diagnosis for appropriate clinical management. At present, nuclear imaging of cardiac amyloidosis is predominantly accomplished with bone-seeking radiotracers, such as 99m-technetium-labeled pyrophosphate ((99m)Tc-PYP), 99m-technetium-methylene diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-MDP), and 99m-technetium-3,3,-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid ((99m)Tc-DPD), with conflicting results in terms of diagnostic performance, with the exception for (99m)Tc-DPD, which may differentiate light-chain amyloidosis from transthyretin-related cardiac amyloidosis. Although other non-bone-seeking radiotracers such as iodine-123-labeled amyloid P component ((123)I-SAP), 123-iodine-Meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-mIBG), 99m-technetium-labeled protease inhibitor, and indium-111-labeled amyloid antibodies have also shown some success in identifying cardiac amyloidosis, the future, however, may lie in labeling derivatives of thioflavin-T. With the recent success of visualizing deposition of amyloid β in the brain, the US Food and Drug Administration-approved PET imaging agent (18)F-florbetapir may be used to target cardiac amyloidosis next.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8593153,Impaired activity of volume-sensitive anion channel during lactacidosis-induced swelling in neuronally differentiated NG108-15 cells,"Acidosis coupled to lactate accumulation, called lactacidosis, occurs in cerebral ischemia or trauma and is known to cause persistent swelling in neuronal and glial cells. It is therefore possible that mechanisms of cell volume regulation are impaired during lactacidosis. Here we tested this possibility using neuronally differentiated NG108-15 cells. These cells responded to a hypotonic challenge with osmotic swelling followed by a regulatory volume decrease (RVD) under physiological pH conditions in the absence of lactate. Under normotonic conditions, sustained cell swelling without subsequent RVD was induced by exposure to lactate-containing solution with acidic pH (6.4 or 6.2), but not with physiological pH (7.4). Under whole-cell patch-clamp, osmotic swelling was found to activate outwardly rectifying Cl(-) currents in cells exposed to control hypotonic solution. A Cl(-) channel blocker, NPPB, inhibited both RVD and the swelling-activated Cl(-) current. RVD and the volume-sensitive Cl(-) current were also markedly inhibited by lactacidosis (pH 6.4 or 6.2), but neither by application of lactate with physiological pH (7.4) nor by acidification without lactate (pH 6.2). RT-PCR analysis showed mRNA expression of two isoforms of proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters, MCT1 and MCT8, in differentiated NG108-15 cells. Thus, we conclude that persistence of neuronal cell swelling under lactacidosis is coupled to an impairment of the activity of the volume-sensitive Cl(-) channel and to dysfunction of RVD. It is also suggested that the volume-sensitive Cl(-) channel is inhibited by intracellular acidification induced by MCT-mediated proton influx under lactacidosis.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8632180,Minimal Age-Related Alterations in Behavioral and Hematological Parameters in Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) Knockout Mice,"Since the discovery in 2001, the G protein-coupled trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) has become an important focus of research targeted on evaluation of its role in the central nervous system (CNS). Meanwhile, impact of TAAR1 in the peripheral organs is less investigated. Expression of TAAR1 was demonstrated in different peripheral tissues: pancreatic beta-cells, stomach, intestines, white blood cells (WBC), and thyroid. However, the role of TAAR1 in regulation of hematological parameters has not been investigated yet. In this study, we performed analysis of anxiety-related behaviors, a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte fragility, as well as FT3/FT4 thyroid hormones levels in adult and middle-aged TAAR1 knockout mice. Complete blood count analysis was performed on a Siemens Advia 2120i hematology analyzer and included more than 35 measured and calculated parameters. Erythrocyte fragility test evaluated spherocytosis pathologies of red blood cells (RBC). No significant alterations in essentially all these parameters were found in mice without TAAR1. However, comparative aging analysis has revealed a decreased neutrophils level in the middle-aged TAAR1 knockout mouse group. Minimal alterations in these parameters observed in TAAR1 knockout mice suggest that future TAAR1-based therapies should exert little hematological effect and thus will likely have a good safety profile.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8632181,Protein Kinase C delta Gene Depletion Protects Against Methamphetamine-Induced Impairments in Recognition Memory and ERK1/2 Signaling via Upregulation of Glutathione Peroxidase-1 Gene,"Accumulating evidence has suggested that repeated treatment with methamphetamine (MA) resulted in cognitive impairments. Importantly, we show that selective upregulation of protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of wild-type mice persisted for 28 days post withdrawal of MA. On day 28, the MA-induced increase in phospho-PKC delta expression and decrease in phospho-ERK1/2 expression were significantly attenuated by both the Src inhibitor PP2 and the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390. However, neither protein kinase A inhibitor H89 nor calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN93 attenuated MA-induced alterations in phospho-PKC delta expression and phospho-ERK1/2 expression. Since PKC delta knockout (KO) significantly increased the expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1, we also utilized GPx-1 KO and GPx-1-overexpressing transgenic (GPx-1 TG) mice. Repeated MA treatment induced cognitive impairment, as assessed by the novel object recognition test. Moreover, the extent of cognitive impairment correlated with the extent of increased phospho-PKC delta expression and decreased GPx1 expression. In the absence of MA, exposure to novel objects increased phospho-ERK1/2 and GPx-1 expression in the PFC; however, these expression levels were decreased in the presence of MA. PKC delta KO and GPx-1 TG mice each exhibited significantly attenuated MA-induced decreases in phospho-ERK1/2 and GPx-1 expression. Consistently, PKC delta inhibition induces GPx/GSH-dependent antioxidant systems. More importantly, the antipsychotic drug clozapine significantly protected against cognitive impairment and was associated with alterations in phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-PKC delta expression. However, GPx-1 KO potentiated MA-induced cognitive deficits and alterations in phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-PKC delta expression. These results suggest that MA induces cognitive impairment by inhibiting ERK1/2 signaling, activating PKC delta, and inactivating GPx-1 by upregulating Src kinase or the D1 receptor. They also suggest that clozapine requires activation of ERK1/2 signaling via positive modulation between the phospho-PKC delta and GPx-1 genes to restore cognitive function.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8632182,Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1 Signaling in Activated Lymphocytes,"Although most research to date on Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) has focused on its role in the brain, it has been recognized since its discovery in 2001 that TAAR1 mRNA is expressed in peripheral tissues as well, suggesting that this receptor may play a role in non-neurological pathways. This study reports TAAR1 expression, signaling and functionality in rhesus monkey lymphocytes. We detected a high level of TAAR1 protein in immortalized rhesus monkey B cell lines and a significant upregulation of TAAR1 protein expression in rhesus monkey lymphocytes following PHA treatment. Through screening a wide range of signaling pathways for their upregulation following TAAR1 activation by its potent agonist methamphetamine, we identified two transcription factors, CREB and NFAT, which are commonly associated with immune activation. Furthermore, we observed a TAAR1-dependent phosphorylation of PKA and PKC following treatment with methamphetamine in transfected HEK293 cells, immortalized rhesus monkey B cells and PHA-activated rhesus monkey lymphocytes. Accordingly, the high levels of TAAR1 that we observed on lymphocytes are inducible and fully functional, capable of transmitting a signal likely via PKA and PKC activation following ligand binding. More importantly, an increase in TAAR1 receptor expression is concomitant with lymphocyte immune activation, suggesting a possible role for TAAR1 in the generation or regulation of an immune response. TAAR1 is emerging as a potential therapeutic target, with regard to its ability to modulate brain monoamines. The current data raises the possibility that TAAR1-targeted drugs may also alter immune function.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8624023,Human transthyretin intronic open reading frames are not independently expressed in vivo or part of functional transcripts,"The human transthyretin (TTR) gene encodes a protein composed of four identical subunits with an important role in the plasma transport of thyroid hormone T4 and retinol. TTR spans 7.6 kilobases and consists of four exons. Two independent open reading frames (ORFs) with putative regulatory sequences have been described in the first and third introns, but their function--if any--is unknown. We have screened human cDNA libraries to determine if these sequences are transcribed. Transcripts of both ORFs were found in liver, pancreas and brain. Hybridization of the two sequences with multiple-tissue Northern blots further confirmed these results and revealed transcript sizes of approximately 1.5 and approximately 2.2 kb for ORF 1, and approximately 5.2 and approximately 7.8 kb for ORF 2. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) was performed to characterize the full-length cDNAs containing each sequence. All products containing the ORFs were continuous in the genomic sequence corresponding to unspliced or partially spliced TTR. No evidence was found for novel transcripts containing productively spliced products of either ORF, or for shorter transcripts using the promoter and polyadenylation signals associated with them. ORF 1 RACE products identified in liver, pancreas and brain correspond to TTR transcripts in which intron 1 had not been removed; the transcripts containing ORF 2 may represent TTR hnRNA.

8617621,Evidence that glial cells attenuate G47R transthyretin accumulation in the central nervous system,"Amyloidogenic protein forms amyloid aggregations at membranes leading to dysfunction of amyloid clearance and amyloidosis. Glial cells function in the clearance and degradation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain. This study aimed to clarify the reason why amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) rarely accumulates in the CNS. We pathologically analyzed the relationship between amyloid deposition with basement membranes or glial cells in a rare case of ATTR leptomeningeal amyloidosis. In addition, we compared the cytotoxicity of ATTR G47R, the amyloidosis-causing mutation in the case studied (n = 1), and Aβ in brains from patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n = 6). In the subarachnoid space of the ATTR G47R case, most amyloids accumulated at the components of basement membranes. On the CNS surface, ATTR accumulations were retained by astrocytic end feet. In areas where glial end feet enveloped ATTR, ubiquitination and micro-vacuolation of ATTR was evident. The colocalization of GFAP and ubiquitin was also evident. The accumulation of ATTR G47R in the CNS was negatively correlated with the prevalence of astrocytes. Quantitatively, amyloid deposits along the vessels were mostly partial in cerebral Aβ angiopathy cases and nearly complete along the basement membrane in the ATTR G47R case. The vascular expressions of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin were severely reduced in areas with ATTR G47R deposition, but not in areas with Aβ deposition. The vascular protein level recovered in the ATTR G47R case when vessels entered into areas of parenchyma that were rich in astrocytes. In addition, the strong interactions between the transthyretin variant and basement membranes may have led to dysfunction of transthyretin clearance and leptomeningeal amyloidosis. The present study was the first to show that glial cells may attenuate G47R transthyretin accumulation in the CNS.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The assay has a linear range of 1-4 ng transthyretin added per well. The within-day and between-day coefficients of variation are 5.1 and 6.1%, respectively. The concentration of transthyretin in CSF (ranging from 5 to 20 mg per L) correlated significantly with the corresponding serum concentrations (range 170-420 mg/l).

8617600,Biophysical characterization and modulation of Transthyretin Ala97Ser,"<strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>Ala97Ser (A97S) is the major transthyretin (TTR) mutation in Taiwanese patients of familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), characterized by a late-onset but rapidly deteriorated neuropathy. Tafamidis can restore the stability of some mutant TTR tetramers and slow down the progression of TTR-FAP. However, there is little understanding of the biophysical features of A97S-TTR mutant and the pharmacological modulation effect of tafamidis on it. This study aims to delineate the biophysical characteristics of A97S-TTR and the pharmacological modulation effect of tafamidis on this mutant.<br /><br /><strong>METHOD: </strong>The stability of TTR tetramers was assessed by urea denaturation and differential scanning calorimetry. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure the binding constant of tafamidis to TTR. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) titration experiment was used to map out the tafamidis binding site.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Chemical and thermal denaturation confirmed the destabilization effect of A97S. Consistent with other the amyloidogenic mutant, A97S-TTR has slightly lower conformational stability. NMR revealed the binding site of A97S-TTR with tafamidis is at the thyroxine binding pocket. The ITC experiments documented the high affinity of the binding which can effectively stabilize the A97S-TTR tetramer.<br /><br /><strong>INTERPRETATION: </strong>This study confirmed the structural modulation effect of tafamidis on A97S-TTR and implied the potential therapeutic benefit of tafamidis for A97S TTR-FAP. This approach can be applied to investigate the modulation effect of tafamidis on other rare TTR variants and help to make individualized choices of available treatments for FAP patients.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8624066,Subcellular localization of transporters along the rat blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebral-spinal fluid barrier by in vivo biotinylation,"Nutrient transporters and ABC efflux pumps at the blood-brain barrier are major determinants of drug penetration into the brain. Immunohistochemical analysis of transporter subcellular localization is challenging due to the close apposition of the luminal and abluminal microvessel plasma membranes. We employed in vivo perfusion of biotinylation reagent through rat brain microvessels to domain-specifically label proteins exposed on the microvessel luminal surface. Using this approach, we analyzed the luminal/abluminal localization of a number of blood-brain barrier transporters identified by quantitative PCR profiling as being highly expressed and enriched in rat brain endothelial cells compared with whole brain. We also examined the apical/basal-lateral distribution of transporters in the choroid plexus, a secondary site for transport of nutrients between the blood and CNS. We detected P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (Abcb1), ATP-binding cassette (Abc) g2, multidrug resistance protein (Mrp) 4 (Abcc4), glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) (Slc2a1), Lat1 (Slc7a5), and monocarboxylate transporter-1 (Mct1) (Slc16a1) on the luminal surface of rat cerebral microvessels by both immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting of in vivo biotinylated proteins. Mrp1 (Abcc1) appeared primarily abluminal by immunofluorescence staining, and was barely detectable in the biotinylated protein fraction. Organic anion transporter (Oat) 3 (Slc22a8), organic anion transporter polypeptide (Oatp) 2b1 (Slco2b1, Oatpb), and Mrp5 (Abcc5) were not detected on the luminal surface using either method, while Oatp1a4 (Slco1a4, Oatp2) appeared to partially localize to the microvessel lumen by immunofluorescence staining, but was not detected in the biotinylated protein fraction by Western blotting. Lat1, Mrp1 and Mrp4 were detected on the basal-lateral surface of lateral ventricle choroid plexus epithelial cells. Mrp5, Oct3 and Oatp2b1 (Oatpb) were detected in the ependymal cells lining the ventricle. We did not detect Pgp expression in choroid plexus by immunofluorescence staining.

SDB was defined as apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5/h. Multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) defined as death, heart transplantation and acute heart failure.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Seventy CA patients were included (31 AL, 22 m-TTR, 17 WT-TTR). The mean ± standard deviation age and left ventricular ejection fraction were 71 ± 12 years and 49% ± 13% and median (interquartile range) N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 3,932 (1,607; 7,028) pg/mL. The prevalence of SDB was 90% without difference between amyloidosis types. SDB was central in 27% and obstructive in 73%. AL had less frequent severe SDB compared to m-TTR and WT-TTR (P = 0.015) but longer time with peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 90% (P = 0.037). After a median follow-up of 7.5 (2.8; 14.9) months, 49% patients experienced MACE. Time with nocturnal SpO2 < 90% was the only independent predictor of MACE. The best-identified threshold was 30 min. Values > 30 min were associated with bad prognosis (Log-rank χ(2): 8.01, P value = 0.005). Using binomial logistic regression, determinants of time with nocturnal SpO2 < 90% were New York Heart Association class (P = 0.011), and log-NT-proBNP (P = 0.04) but not AHI.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>In CA population, prevalence of SDB is high (90%) and dominated by the obstructive pattern.

8617545,ABCC drug efflux pumps and organic anion uptake transporters in human gliomas and the blood-tumor barrier,"Delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain and its neoplasms depends on the presence of membrane transport proteins in the blood-brain barrier and in the target cells. The cellular and subcellular localization of these membrane transporters determines the drug accessibility to the brain and its tumors. We therefore analyzed the expression and localization of six members of the multidrug resistance protein family of ATP-dependent efflux pumps (ABCC1-ABCC6, formerly MRP1-MRP6) and of six organic anion uptake transporters (OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP1C1, OATP2B1, and OATP4A1) in 61 human glioma specimens of different histologic subtypes. Real-time PCRs indicated expressions of ABCC1, ABCC3, ABCC4, and ABCC5. In addition, we detected expressions of the OATP uptake transporter genes SLCO1A2, SLCO1C1, SLCO2B1, and SLCO4A1. At the protein level, however, only OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 were detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy in the luminal membrane of endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier and the blood-tumor barrier, but not in the glioma cells. ABCC4 and ABCC5 proteins were the major ABCC subfamily members in gliomas, localized both at the luminal side of the endothelial cells and in the glioma cells of astrocytic tumors and in the astrocytic portions of oligoastrocytomas. These results indicate that expression of ABCC4 and ABCC5 is associated with an astrocytic phenotype, in accordance with their expression in astrocytes and with the higher chemoresistance of astrocytic tumors as compared with oligodendrogliomas.

We also demonstrate the feasibility of co-staining with antibodies and compare the LCO staining with standard amyloid-specific probes. The LCO protocol enables high-resolution imaging of several different protein aggregates, such as Abeta1-42, Abeta1-42(E22G), Transthyretin V30M and human Tau, in the Drosophila brain. Abeta and Tau aggregates could also be distinguished from each other because of distinct LCO emission spectra. Furthermore, this protocol enables three-dimensional brain mapping of amyloid distribution in whole-mount Drosophila brains. The use of p-FTAA combined with other probes, antibodies and/or dyes will aid the rapid characterization of various amyloid deposits in the rapidly growing number of Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

However the functions on these devices are often limited due to an inability to effectively and chronically interface with neural tissue. The insertion of devices has been shown to result in significant cellular and vascular trauma surrounding the insertion site. In particular, the up-regulation of genes involved in neuronal degeneration are believed to contribute to the loss of neuronal tissue. RNA interference is a novel technique for the development of antisense therapeutics for the post-transcriptional silencing of specific genes. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of RNA interference for gene-specific silencing in vivo, a short interfering RNA targeting transthyretin, was infused prior to unilateral device insertion. Injection of siRNA was found to significantly reduce the expression of transthyretin mRNA when expression was assessed at 1 week following device insertion. Concomitant decreases in transthyretin protein levels were also observed.

However, it is possible that some of the effects of gamma-PKC gene deletion also may be due to altered gene expression. To examine alterations in gene expression, microarray analyses were performed on striatal tissue from wild types and mutants. A total of 143 genes and ESTs were identified as potential candidates related to differences between null mutants and wild types. Confirmation studies using qRT-PCR indicated that the expression of transthyretin was increased about 8-fold in striatum of naive mutants compared to wild types. The effect of chronic ethanol treatment on transthyretin expression was analyzed because gamma-PKC mutants do not develop tolerance to chronic ethanol treatment. Ethanol treatment of mutants reversed the dramatic increase in transthyretin expression seen in naive and control-diet treated mutants, but did not affect transthyretin expression in wild types.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8615401,The choroid plexus removes beta-amyloid from brain cerebrospinal fluid,"beta-Amyloid (Abeta) concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the brain may be regulated by the choroid plexus, which forms a barrier between blood and brain CSF. Abeta uptake from CSF was determined as its volume of distribution (V(D)) into isolated rat choroid plexus tissue. The V(D) of [125I]Abeta1-40 was corrected by subtraction of the V(D) of [14C]sucrose, a marker for extracellular space and diffusion. Abeta uptake into choroid plexus was time and temperature dependent. Uptake of [125I]Abeta was saturable. Abeta uptake was not affected by addition of transthyretin or apolipoprotein E3. In studies with primary culture monolayers of choroidal epithelial cells in Transwells, Abeta permeability across cells, corrected by [(14)C]sucrose, was greater from the CSF-facing membrane than from the blood-facing membrane. Similarly, cellular accumulation of [125I]Abeta was concentrative from both directions and was greater from the CSF-facing membrane, suggesting a bias for efflux. Overall, these results suggest the choroid plexus selectively cleanses Abeta from the CSF by an undetermined mechanism(s), potentially reducing Abeta from normal brains and the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Here, these structures are analyzed together with our lower resolution cryo-EM structure, and multibody 3D auto-refinement against single-particle cryo-EM data was used to characterize the dynamics of the interaction of CD98hc and LAT1. It is shown that the CD98hc ectodomain and the LAT1 extracellular surface share no substantial interface. This allows the CD98hc ectodomain to have a high degree of movement within the extracellular space. The functional implications of these aspects are discussed together with the structure determination.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8617633,Efflux proteins at the blood-brain barrier: review and bioinformatics analysis,"1. Efflux proteins at the blood-brain barrier provide a mechanism for export of waste products of normal metabolism from the brain and help to maintain brain homeostasis. They also prevent entry into the brain of a wide range of potentially harmful compounds such as drugs and xenobiotics. 2. Conversely, efflux proteins also hinder delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain and central nervous system used to treat brain tumours and neurological disorders. For bypassing efflux proteins, a comprehensive understanding of their structures, functions and molecular mechanisms is necessary, along with new strategies and technologies for delivery of drugs across the blood-brain barrier. 3. We review efflux proteins at the blood-brain barrier, classified as either ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (P-gp, BCRP, MRPs) or solute carrier (SLC) transporters (OATP1A2, OATP1A4, OATP1C1, OATP2B1, OAT3, EAATs, PMAT/hENT4 and MATE1). 4. This includes information about substrate and inhibitor specificity, structural organisation and mechanism, membrane localisation, regulation of expression and activity, effects of diseases and conditions and the principal technique used for in vivo analysis of efflux protein activity: positron emission tomography (PET). 5. We also performed analyses of evolutionary relationships, membrane topologies and amino acid compositions of the proteins, and linked these to structure and function.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8615344,Effects of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on brain gene expression,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are essential structural components of the central nervous system. Their role in controlling learning and memory has been well documented. A nutrigenomic approach with high-density microarrays was used to reveal brain gene-expression changes in response to different PUFA-enriched diets in rats. In aged rats fed throughout life with PUFA-enriched diets, genes with altered expressions included transthyretin, alpha-synuclein, and calmodulins, which play important roles in synaptic plasticity and learning. The effect of perinatal omega-3 PUFA supply on gene expression later in life also was studied. Several genes showed similar changes in expression in rats fed omega-3-deficient diets in the perinatal period, regardless of whether they or their mothers were fed omega-3 PUFA-sufficient diets after giving birth. In this experiment, among the down-regulated genes were a kainate glutamate receptor and a DEAD-box polypeptide. Among the up-regulated genes were a chemokine-like factor, a tumor necrosis factor receptor, and cytochrome c. The possible involvement of the genes with altered expression attributable to different diets in different brain regions in young and aged rats and the possible mode of regulatory action of PUFA also are discussed. We conclude that PUFA-enriched diets lead to significant changes in expression of several genes in the central nervous tissue, and these effects appear to be mainly independent of their effects on membrane composition. The direct effects of PUFA on transcriptional modulators, the downstream developmentally and tissue-specifically activated elements might be one of the clues to understanding the beneficial effects of the omega-3 PUFA on the nervous system.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8625145,Genetic programming by the proteolytic fragments of the amyloid precursor protein: Somewhere between confusion and clarity,"Mice engineered to overexpress disease-causing mutant amyloid precursor proteins (APP) display plaque deposition, but lack the hyperphosphorylated tau and massive neuronal loss characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Global gene expression profiles of brain regions from AD patients show upregulation of proapoptotic and inflammatory genes and downregulation of neurotrophic, MAPK, phosphatase, and synaptic genes, while a profile of mice overexpressing a mutant APP shows the opposite trends in apoptotic and neurotrophic genes. The proteolytic fragments of the amyloid precursor protein have distinct biological actions. Both the gamma-secretase cleaved COOH-terminal fragment (CTFgamma) and the alpha-secretase cleaved NH2-terminal of APP (sAPPalpha) can regulate gene expression. While AD and CTFgamma can lead to toxicity and cell death, sAPPalpha promotes neurite outgrowth, enhances memory, and protects against a variety of insults, including Abeta toxicity. In Abeta, Abeta levels increase while sAPPalpha levels decrease. These subtleties in the levels of APP cleavage products are not reproduced in mice overexpressing mutant APP. In fact, the gene expression changes driven by sAPPalpha, such as increases in transthyretin and insulin-like growth factor 2, may protect these mice from high levels of Abeta.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The long-term prognosis of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome remains uncertain. Patients: We describe the clinical features and course of four adults in a family with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome with athetoid type cerebral palsy.

8615310,Asymmetry of glutamine transporters in cultured neural cells,"Transfer of glutamine between astrocytes and neurons is an essential part of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in the brain. Transport of glutamine was investigated in primary cultures of astrocytes and neurons and compared to glutamine transport in cell lines with glial and neuronal properties. Glutamine uptake in astrocytes was mainly mediated by general amino acid transporters with properties similar to ASCT2, LAT1, LAT2, SN1 and y(+)LAT2. In cultured neurons, transport activities were detected consistent with the presence of LAT1, LAT2 and y(+)LAT2, but the most prominent activity was a novel Na+-dependent glutamine transporter that could be inhibited by D-aspartate. The mRNA for system A isoforms ATA1 and ATA2 was detected in both neurons and astrocytes, but system A activity was only detected in neurons. ASCT2 on the other hand appeared to be astrocyte-specific. The cell lines F98 and 108CC-15, having astroglial and neuronal properties, respectively, expressed sets of glutamine transporters that were unrelated to those of the corresponding primary culture and are thus of limited use as models to study transfer of glutamine between astrocytes and neurons.

The patient was a 29-year-old female who presented with headaches. A computed tomography scan revealed a tumorous lesion at the pineal region and hydrocephalus. The resected tumor was composed of columnar and cuboidal cells showing characteristics of papillary growth. The tumor cells exhibited diffuse and intense immunoreactivity to cytokeratins and neural cell adhesion molecule. The tumor expressed abundant levels of transthyretin (prealbumin) and appeared ependymal in nature, with numerous microlumens delineated by punctate and ring-like patterns in epithelial membrane antigen staining. Reactivity to synaptophysin and glial fibrillary acidic protein was observed only in the infiltrated non-neoplastic pineal parenchyma. These histological characteristics matched the description of the recently reported papillary tumor of the pineal region thought to originate from the specialized ependyma of the subcommissural organ (SCO). Transthyretin expression of the present case further supports the likelihood of SCO origin, as transthyretin is one of the proteins presumed to be secreted by human SCO.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

These cell lines exhibit temperature-sensitive cell growth due to the expression of ts SV 40 large T-antigen. Mouse brain (TM-BBB) and rat brain (TR-BBB) and rat retinal (TR-iBRB) capillary endothelial cell lines appear to have a spindle-fiber shaped morphology and exhibit the typical endothelial markers, such as von Willebrand factor and acetylated low-density lipoprotein uptake. These cell lines express in vivo influx and efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and GLUT1, which is capable of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport. TM-BBB cells are able to undergo efflux transport of cyclosporin A, which is a substrate for P-gp transport activity. They may also express oatp2 and exhibit dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and digoxin uptake activity. TR-BBB cells express the mRNA of multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (MRP1) and a large neutral amino acid transporter, which consists of LAT1 and 4F2hc. TR-iBRB cells exhibit pH-dependent L-lactic acid transport activity and express the mRNA of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and 2. The choroid plexus epithelial cell line (TR-CSFB) has polygonal cell morphology, expresses the typical choroid plexus epithelial cell marker, transthyretin, and has Na+,K+-ATPase located on the apical side. TR-CSFB cells also exhibit amino acid transport activity which has been observed in vivo.

The albumin ratio was normal for both the patients and the referents.

The gene contained four exons. A ""TATA box"" sequence (5'-TATATAA-3') and a ""CAAT box"" sequence (5'-GTCAAT-3') were located 23 and 95 nucleotides upstream, respectively, from the major transcription start site. Nucleotides -51 to -189 were highly conserved (93% homology between rats and humans, 97% homology between rats and mice). Tandem repeats of sequences of 5'-AC-3' and 5'-ACACATGC-3' in the 5' flanking region, of 5'-GAAA-3' in the first intron, and of 5'-GT-3' in the third intron of the gene were observed. Using specific cDNA probes, tissue specificity and regulation of transthyretin mRNA biosynthesis during embryogenesis were analyzed. Transthyretin expression occurred first in the yolk sac, then decreased when expression increased in fetal liver. Presumptive choroid plexus cells in the inner lining of the neural tube expressed transthyretin early in gestation (11 days before birth) with a maximum immediately preceding the spurt of brain growth around birth. Partial hepatectomy of adult rats induced both an acute phase response and regenerative growth in liver. The decrease in transcription of the transthyretin gene in liver, which is characteristic for the acute phase response, was overridden by stimulation of gene expression after partial hepatectomy. This stimulation also affected transthyretin expression in choroid plexus.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

8592296,The expression of viral and cellular genes in papillomas of the choroid plexus induced in transgenic mice,"A line of transgenic mice that carry the SV40 gene for the large Tumor antigen express this protein during the first two weeks of life in brain tissue. By 30-40 days after birth, independently derived multiple foci of abnormal cells appear throughout the choroid plexus. After 90 days, higher levels of T antigen and rapid tumor growth are detected and all these animals die in a narrow time span, between 100-120 days. In situ hybridization with tissue sections and Northern blot analysis have been employed to follow the steady state levels of SV40 RNA and the p53 oncogene RNA levels in normal and tumor tissues. The level of SV40 RNA is quite variable between tumor cells in a section. This heterogeneity of T antigen mRNA levels could permit the selection of cells (from the multiple foci) expressing higher levels of T antigen and growing more rapidly. The increased levels of p53 RNA observed in tumor cells could then result from the active growth state of these cells or a more direct transcriptional activation. Two cellular genes, transthyretin and the 5-HT1C serotonin receptor, both of which are preferentially expressed in normal choroid plexus cells, were also examined for RNA production in these tumors of the choroid plexus. Both of these genes produced high levels of RNA in tumor tissue indicating the retention of well differentiated gene expression in these tumor tissues. This reflects, at the level of gene expression, the well differentiated morphology of these papillomas of the choroid plexus. Interestingly, as cell lines have been derived from these tumors, both the choroid plexus specific RNA species (for 5-HT1C receptor) and characteristic morphology were lost and an increase in T antigen levels was observed.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

In general, cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) have been distinguished by showing binding specificity for retinol or retinoic acid, respectively. However, the component found in embryo brain cytosol exhibited binding affinity for both retinol and retinoic acid, being similar in less ligand-specificity to CRBP (F) which was originally recognized in fish eye cytosol. Moreover, the component also showed a lack of binding affinity for prealbumin (PA), excluding the possibility that chicken plasma RBP was contaminated in the cytosol.

Although the incidence of all amyloidoses increases with age, for some types of amyloidosis aging is known as the main direct risk factor, and these types are typically diseases of elderly people. More than 10 different precursor proteins are known to cause age-associated amyloidosis; these proteins include amyloid β protein, α-synuclein, transthyretin, islet amyloid polypeptide, atrial natriuretic factor, and the newly discovered epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1. Except for intracerebral amyloidoses, most age-related amyloidoses have been little studied. Indeed, in view of the increasing life expectancy in our societies, understanding how aging is involved in the process of amyloid fibril accumulation and the effects of amyloid deposits on the aging body is extremely important. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the nature of amyloid precursor proteins, the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and pathogenesis of amyloidosis, and recent advances in our understanding of age-related amyloidoses outside the brain.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8624205,New Insights into Epigenetic and Pharmacological Regulation of Amyloid-Degrading Enzymes,"Currently, deficit of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) clearance from the brain is considered as one of the possible causes of amyloid accumulation and neuronal death in the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A beta clearance can involve either specific proteases present in the brain or A beta-binding/transport proteins. Among amyloid-degrading enzymes the most intensively studied are neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). Since ageing and development of brain pathologies is often accompanied by a deficit in the levels of expression and activity of these enzymes in the brain, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms involved in their regulation. We have recently reported that NEP and also an A beta-transport protein, transthyretin are epigenetically co-regulated by the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and this regulation depends on the cell type and APP(695) isoform expression in a process that can be regulated by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Gleevec. We have now extended our work and shown that, unlike NEP, another amyloid-degrading enzyme, IDE, is not related to over-expression of APP(695) in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells but is up-regulated by APP(751) and APP(770) isoforms independently of AICD but correlating with reduced HDAC1 binding to its promoter. Studying the effect of the nuclear retinoid X receptor agonist, bexarotene, on NEP and IDE expression, we have found that both enzymes can be up-regulated by this compound but this mechanism is not APP-isoform specific and does not involve AICD but, on the contrary, affects HDAC1 occupancy on the NEP gene promoter. These new insights into the mechanisms of NEP and IDE regulation suggest possible pharmacological targets in developing AD therapies.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Numerous nerve cells in the cerebral wall and in various brain stem nuclei were positively stained for alpha-fetoprotein, albumin and prealbumin. All appropriate controls were negative.

8592201,The presence of S-sulfonated transthyretin in commercial human serum albumin solutions: Potential contribution to neuropathy,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Commercial solutions of human serum albumin (HSA) are administered to critically ill patients for the treatment of shock, restoration of blood volume, and the acute management of burns. Previously, conflicting results on the effects of HSA administration have been reported varying from a favorable increase in total plasma antioxidant capacity to a higher mortality rate in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. These results could be partially explained due to the known heterogeneity of HSA solutions. We report the discovery of S-sulfonated human transthyretin (hTTR) in HSA solutions.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Proteomics was performed on commercially available solutions of 5% HSA by LC-MS analysis. The MS charge envelope for hTTR was deconvolved to the uncharged native hTTR parent mass (13,762 Da). The parent mass was then integrated, and relative proportions of the 2 major species of hTTR, native and S-sulfonated hTTR (13,842 Da), were calculated.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The majority of hTTR found in 5% commercial HSA solutions is in the S-sulfonated form regardless of the age of the HSA solution. S-sulfonation of hTTR at the free cysteine residue in position 10 appears to be the result of a mixed disulfide exchange possibly with S-cysteinylated hTTR or S-cysteinylated HSA. hTTR is a tetramer composed of four identical monomers each containing a reduced cysteine residue in position 10. S-sulfonation of hTTR at this cysteine residue can destabilize the hTTR tetramer, an important step in the formation of TTR-related amyloid fibrils.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Administration of a commercial HSA solution that already contains S-sulfonated hTTR could potentially contribute to the development of amyloid-related/polyneuropathy in the critically ill.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Patterns of dietary intake of fats and other nutrients may be partly responsible. Recent work with transgenic mice overexpressing the beta-amyloid precursor protein suggests that anti-Abeta antibodies enhance clearance of the Abeta protein from the brain and reduce plaque burden. This has been shown even with anti-Abeta antibodies that do not enter the brain. Many factors other than circulating anti-Abeta antibodies may influence this important process of Abeta clearance, including the Abeta-binding elements, apolipoproteins E and J, circulating LDL, HDL, and LRP, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and transthyretin. Also important may be clearance of antibody-antigen complexes from the circulation, as well as complement, metals, and estrogen. Dietary intake of lipids may influence the ability of Abeta-binding proteins to enhance clearance of Abeta from the brain to blood.

Hypothyroidism was induced by administering methimazole in drinking water (60 mg/kg/day). In striatum, motor cortex and cerebellum of hypothyroid rats LP was not modified, whereas LP and ROS increased in amygdala and hippocampus of hypothyroid rats at the third week of treatment with methimazole as compared to euthyroid group values. Regarding NOS participation, only hippocampal constitutive-NOS activity was increased, accompanied by an augmentation in nNOS expression.

On the basis of the authors' research, several processes seem to be important in relation to the still-speculative pathogenesis: increased transcription and accumulation of amyloid-b precursor protein and accumulation of its proteolytic fragment amyloid-b; abnormal accumulation of components related to lipid metabolism (eg, low-density lipoprotein receptors and cholesterol; accumulation of cholesterol is possibly caused by its abnormal trafficking); oxidative stress; accumulations of other Alzheimer-related proteins including phosphorylated tau; a milieu of muscle cellular aging in which these changes occur. The authors' basic hypothesis is that overexpression of amyloid-b precursor protein within the aging muscle fibers is an early upstream event causing the subsequent pathogenic cascade.

We also studied actin levels in CSF as a marker of the biochemical role of these two proteins in the cytoskeleton. We show that TTR levels in CSF were significantly decreased in AD patients compared to controls and negatively correlated with the senile plaque (SP) abundance. Moreover, actin levels were positively linked to TTR levels and increased in CSF samples of patients homozygous for the ApoE epsilon4-allele. We propose that TTR and ApoE4 may have competition in the aggregation of Abeta and its deposition in the SP of AD brain.

8632149,Ocular transient receptor potential channel function in health and disease,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels sense and transduce environmental stimuli into Ca2(+) transients that in turn induce responses essential for cell function and adaptation. These non-selective channels with variable Ca2(+) selectivity are grouped into seven different subfamilies containing 28 subtypes based on differences in amino acid sequence homology. Many of these subtypes are expressed in the eye on both neuronal and non-neuronal cells where they affect a host of stress-induced regulatory responses essential for normal vision maintenance. This article reviews our current knowledge about the expression, function and regulation of TRPs in different eye tissues. We also describe how under certain conditions TRP activation can induce responses that are maladaptive to ocular function. Furthermore, the possibility of an association between TRP mutations and disease is considered. These findings contribute to evidence suggesting that drug targeting TRP channels may be of therapeutic benefit in a clinical setting. We point out issues that must be more extensively addressed before it will be possible to decide with certainty that this is a realistic endeavor. Another possible upshot of future studies is that disease process progression can be better evaluated by profiling changes in tissue specific functional TRP subtype activity as well as their gene and protein expression.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Several analogs had K(i) values in the range 2.1-8.5 microM with greater affinities than that of either L-phenylalanine (K(i)=11 microM) or melphalan (K(i)=55 microM), but lower than DL-2-NAM-7 (K(i)=0.08 microM). The results indicate that regiospecific positioning of the mustard moiety on the aromatic ring in these analogs is very important for optimal affinity for the large neutral amino acid transporter, and that conformational restriction of the DL-2-NAM-7 molecule in benzonorbornane and indane analogs leads to 25- to 60-fold loss, respectively, in affinity.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

8617972,[Analysis of energy balance and risk factors on clinical outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury],"<strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>To observe the energy expenditure in severe traumatic brain injury patients, and to assess the impact of cumulative energy balance on clinical outcomes.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Using prospective self-controlled study, the change in energy expenditure of 42 patients with severe traumatic brain injury was measured by indirect calorimetry (IC). Daily energy intake was recorded. Afterwards, energy balance was calculated. The levels of nutritional biochemical indicators were compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the correlation of cumulative energy balance with clinical outcomes.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Mean practical energy intake of all patients was (6787 ± 1848) kJ/d, and mean negative energy balance was (913 ± 285) kJ/d. The negative energy balance was most crucial in first 3 days after admission. Meanwhile, practical energy intake was significantly lower than target energy intake (kJ: 2859 ± 1370 vs. 6027 ± 899, P < 0.01). The practical energy intake was increased with time, and it was found that the first 14 days were crucial for development of negative energy balance. On 7th day after admission, albumin (g/L) level in plasma was lowest compared with that on 3rd day (29.5 ± 5.0 vs. 35.9 ± 3.8, P < 0.01), and then it was increased gradually returning to normal level on 28 days (34.1 ± 2.8). Three days after admission, prealbumin (mg/L: 122.5 ± 23.3) was obviously lower than normal level, but it rapidly elevated on 7th day (214.3 ± 38.6, P < 0.01) and continued to rise till 28th day (257.7 ± 25.2). On the 3rd day after admission, C-reactive protein (mg/L: 139.5 ± 54.4) was obviously higher than normal level. However, it significantly fell on 7th day (108.4 ± 42.2, P < 0.01), and it continued to fall. Logistic regression analysis showed a strong association of cumulative negative energy balance with infection and upper gastrointestinal bleeding [odds ratio (OR) of infection was 2.130, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.540 to 29.661, P = 0.023; OR of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was 0.083, 95%CI 0.013 to 0.542, P = 0.009].<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Cumulative negative energy balance may be correlated with the occurrence of complications in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

8617963,DNA methylation and histone modification profiles of mouse organic anion transporting polypeptides,"Organic anion transporting polypeptides (rodents, Oatps; human, OATPs) are primarily involved in the transmembrane transportation of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds. Multiple mouse Oatp1 isoforms are closely located on chromosome 6, where each isoform shows distinct tissue distribution; Oatp1b2, Oatp1a6, and Oatp1c1 are expressed exclusively in the liver, kidney, and cerebrum, respectively; Oatp1a1 in the liver and kidney; and Oatp1a4 in the liver and cerebrum. We have identified tissue-dependent differentially methylated region (T-DMR) around the transcriptional start site (TSS) of Oatp1b2, which correlates with its liver-specific expression. Bisulfite sequencing also demonstrated the presence of T-DMRs around the TSS in other Oatp1 genes: CpG dinucleotides at +149 relative to the TSS for Oatp1c1; -48, +101, and +356 for Oatp1a4; -572 and -550 for Oatp1a1; and -122 and +216 for Oatp1a6 were differentially methylated among the liver, kidney, and cerebrum. These methylation profiles were largely consistent with the tissue distribution of Oatp1 mRNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the mRNA expression of Oatp1 genes was accompanied by acetylated histone H3. Human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are located on chromosome 12p12 in the OATP1 cluster; both show predominant expression in the liver. These genes also contained T-DMRs that were hypomethylated in the liver, compared with kidney cortex: -511, -411, and +92 relative to the TSS for OATP1B1 and -331, +70, and +73 for OATP1B3. These results suggest that the difference in epigenetic profiles comprising DNA methylation and histone acetylation determines the distinct tissue distribution of Oatp/OATP mRNAs.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8584627,Identification of genes expressed in the amygdala during the formation of fear memory,"In this study we describe changes of gene expression that occur in the basolateral complex of the mouse amygdala (BLA) during the formation of fear memory. Through the combination of a behavioral training scheme with polymerase chain reaction-based expression analysis (subtractive hybridization and virtual Northern analysis) we were able to identify various gene products that are increased in expression after Pavlovian fear conditioning and are of potential significance for neural plasticity and information storage in the amygdala. In particular, a key enzyme of monoamine metabolism, aldehyde reductase, and the protein sorting and ubiquitination factor Praja1, showed pronounced and learning-specific induction six hours after fear conditioning training. Aldehyde reductase and Praja1, including a novel alternatively spliced isoform termed Praja1a, were induced in the BLA depending on the emotional stimulus presented and showed different expression levels in response to associative conditioning, training stress, and experience of conditioned fear. Stress and fear were further found to induce various signal transduction factors (transthyretin, phosphodiesterase1, protein kinase inhibitor-alpha) and structural reorganization factors (e.g., E2-ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, neuroligin1, actin, UDP-galactose transporter) during training. Our results show that the formation of Pavlovian fear memory is associated with changes of gene expression in the BLA, which may contribute to neural plasticity and the processing of information about both conditioned and unconditioned fear stimuli.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584657,Hereditary dementia with intracerebral hemorrhages and cerebral amyloid angiopathy,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Deposition of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in neuritic plaques is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Mutations in genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1, PSEN2) are associated with increased accumulation of Abeta in neuritic plaques or in the walls of cerebral vessels. Intracerebral hemorrhage occasionally affects patients with AD.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>A Finnish family with dementia in four generations and with frequent co-occurrence of dementia and intracerebral hemorrhage was identified. Clinical features of 14 family members with a cognitive decline were evaluated. All exons in genes encoding APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, cystatin C, transthyretin, gelsolin, and ITM2B were sequenced, and an association study of APP was conducted by identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Neuropathologic examination revealed Alzheimer-type changes with Abeta in neuritic plaques and vessel walls, but the cognitive profile of the patients differed from that in AD, as the visuoconstructive functions and verbal fluency were well preserved even in the moderate stage of the disease. In addition to cognitive decline, five patients had had lobar intracerebral hemorrhages and one was diagnosed with hemosiderin deposits in MRI, suggesting previous cerebral microbleeds. No causative mutations were identified in candidate genes associated with amyloid diseases, but linkage to APP region could not be entirely excluded.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>The family presents an autosomal dominant form of beta-amyloidogenic disease that resembles the Italian, Flemish, and Iowa types of AD.

8584658,Isolation of a set of genes expressed in the choroid plexus of the mouse using suppression subtractive hybridization,"The choroid plexus produces cerebrospinal fluid, providing a specialized environment for the CNS. We previously demonstrated that choroid plexus ependymal cells can enhance nerve regeneration in vivo and promote neurite outgrowth in vitro. To understand the molecular mechanisms of choroid plexus functions, we isolated genes predominantly expressed in the mouse choroid plexus using suppression subtractive hybridization. Out of the 49 complementary DNA (cDNA) fragments isolated in two types of screening, 43 matched known sequences in the database and six were novel. In one type of screening where choroid plexus cDNAs were subtracted with cerebral cortex cDNAs, transthyretin and phosphodiesterase I alpha were predominant. This is consistent with previous reports and supports the authenticity of our approach. In the other type of screening, cDNAs derived from the choroid plexus of neonatal (postnatal day 5) mice were subtracted with cDNAs from the choroid plexus of adult mice. RNA blot and/or in situ hybridization confirmed abundant expression, in the mouse choroid plexus, of the mRNA encoding gelsolin, phospholipid transfer protein, ATP-binding cassette transporter A8 (ABCA8), androgen-inducible aldehyde reductase, and Na(+)/sulfate cotransporter SUT-1. Also, one novel gene (FS88) was found to be expressed in the choroid plexus from neonatal mice. Our data suggest that the choroid plexus cells produce molecules involved in processes such as prevention of fibrillization of amyloid beta-protein (transthyretin and gelsolin), lipid metabolism (phospholipid transfer protein and ABCA8), and detoxification (androgen-inducible aldehyde reductase).",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584660,Brain heterotopia in pharyngeal region. A morphological and immunohistochemical study,"Pharyngeal brain heterotopia is a congenital and generally biologically benign lesion. In contrast to brain heterotopia in the nose, the most common site of this lesion, brain heterotopia in the pharynx is very rare. Pharyngeal heterotopic tissue can be composed of various components, i.e., astrocytes, neurons, ependyma or choroid plexus, oligodendrocytes, retina, and, occasionally, neoplastic nodules. In contrast, nasal lesions are often only composed of astrocytes. We report a case of brain heterotopia in the pharyngeal region, diagnosed in a newborn female infant, causing serious respiratory distress. The infant underwent surgical excision of the lesion, and after 1 year of follow-up, she is recurrence-free. The mass, about 3 cm in diameter and showing no connection with encephalic structures, was characterized by numerous papillary structures and areas containing stellate-like or spindle cells focally forming nodules. Moreover, there was inflammatory infiltration, whereas mitoses, hemorrhages, and necroses were absent. Immunohistochemistry revealed a choroid plexus nature of the papillary formations (S-100, cytokeratins, transthyretin and vimentin-positive) and the presence of glial and neuronal cells in the remaining areas (glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuron-specific enolase, neurofilaments, synaptophysin, and S-100 positive).

8584662,Serum transthyretin monomer as a possible marker of blood-to-CSF barrier disruption,"The CNS is shielded from systemic influences by two separate barriers, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-to-CSF barrier. Failure of either barrier bears profound significance in the etiology and diagnosis of several neurological diseases. Furthermore, selective opening of BBB tight junctions provides an opportunity for delivery of otherwise BBB impermeant drugs. Peripheral assessment of BBB opening can be achieved by detection in blood of brain-specific proteins that extravasate when these endothelial junctions are breached. We developed a proteomic approach to discover clusters of CNS-specific proteins with extravasation into serum that correlates with BBB openings. Protein profiles from blood samples obtained from patients undergoing iatrogenic BBB disruption (BBBD) with intra-arterial hyperosmotic mannitol were compared with pre-BBB opening serum. A low molecular weight protein (14 kDa) identified by mass spectroscopy as transthyretin (TTR) consistently correlated with BBBD. Protein gel electrophoresis and immunodetection confirmed that TTR was indeed extravasated in its monomeric form when CNS barriers were breached. The time course of TTR extravasation was compared with release from the brain of another BBB integrity marker, S-100beta (11 kDa). Kinetic analysis revealed that the appearance of S-100beta, presumably originating from perivascular astrocytic end feet, preceded extravasation of TTR by several minutes. Because TTR is localized primarily in choroid plexus and, as a soluble monomer, in CSF, we concluded that although S-100beta is a marker of BBB integrity, TTR instead may be a peripheral tracer of blood-to-cerebrospinal barrier.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584697,Proteome studies of human cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue using a preparative two-dimensional electrophoresis approach prior to mass spectrometry,"A preparative proteomic approach, involving liquid phase isoelectric focusing (IEF) in combination with one-dimensional electrophoresis and electroelution followed by mass spectrometry and database searches, was found to be an important tool for identifying low-abundant proteins (microgram/L) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and membrane proteins in human frontal cortex. Several neuron-related proteins, such as amyloid precursor-like protein, chromogranins A and B, glial fibrillary acid protein, beta-trace, transthyretin, ubiquitin, and cystatin C, were identified in CSF. Several types of proteins were also characterized from a detergent-solubilized human frontal cortex homogenate including membrane proteins such as synaptophysin, syntaxin and Na+/K+ ATPase. One-third of the identified proteins have not previously been identified in human CSF or human frontal cortex using proteomic techniques. The absence of these proteins in two-dimensional electrophoresis maps might be due to insufficient amounts or low solubility. The advantages of using preparative liquid phase electrophoretic separations for identifying proteins from complex biological mixtures are speed of analysis, high loadability in the IEF separation, nondiscrimination of membrane proteins or low abundance proteins, yielding sufficient amounts for characterization by mass spectrometry. The use of this strategy in proteome studies of CSF/brain tissue is expected to offer new perspectives in studies of the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, and reveal new potential markers for brain disorders.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8584731,"Induction of phase I, II and III drug metabolism/transport by xenobiotics","Drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) play central roles in the metabolism, elimination and detoxification of xenobiotics and drugs introduced into the human body. Most of the tissues and organs in our body are well equipped with diverse and various DMEs including phase I, phase II metabolizing enzymes and phase III transporters, which are present in abundance either at the basal unstimulated level, and/or are inducible at elevated level after exposure to xenobiotics. Recently, many important advances have been made in the mechanisms that regulate the expression of these drug metabolism genes. Various nuclear receptors including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), orphan nuclear receptors, and nuclear factor-erythoroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) have been shown to be the key mediators of drug-induced changes in phase I, phase II metabolizing enzymes as well as phase III transporters involved in efflux mechanisms. For instance, the expression of CYP1 genes can be induced by AhR, which dimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt), in response to many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs). Similarly, the steroid family of orphan nuclear receptors, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), both heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), are shown to transcriptionally activate the promoters of CYP2B and CYP3A gene expression by xenobiotics such as phenobarbital-like compounds (CAR) and dexamethasone and rifampin-type of agents (PXR). The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), which is one of the first characterized members of the nuclear hormone receptor, also dimerizes with RXR and has been shown to be activated by lipid lowering agent fibrate-type of compounds leading to transcriptional activation of the promoters on CYP4A gene. CYP7A was recognized as the first target gene of the liver X receptor (LXR), in which the elimination of cholesterol depends on CYP7A. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was identified as a bile acid receptor, and its activation results in the inhibition of hepatic acid biosynthesis and increased transport of bile acids from intestinal lumen to the liver, and CYP7A is one of its target genes. The transcriptional activation by these receptors upon binding to the promoters located at the 5-flanking region of these CYP genes generally leads to the induction of their mRNA gene expression. The physiological and the pharmacological implications of common partner of RXR for CAR, PXR, PPAR, LXR and FXR receptors largely remain unknown and are under intense investigations. For the phase II DMEs, phase II gene inducers such as the phenolic compounds butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA), tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), green tea polyphenol (GTP), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and the isothiocyanates (PEITC, sulforaphane) generally appear to be electrophiles. They generally possess electrophilic-mediated stress response, resulting in the activation of bZIP transcription factors Nrf2 which dimerizes with Mafs and binds to the antioxidant/electrophile response element (ARE/EpRE) promoter, which is located in many phase II DMEs as well as many cellular defensive enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), with the subsequent induction of the expression of these genes. Phase III transporters, for example, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), and organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (OATP2) are expressed in many tissues such as the liver, intestine, kidney, and brain, and play crucial roles in drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. The orphan nuclear receptors PXR and CAR have been shown to be involved in the regulation of these transporters. Along with phase I and phase II enzyme induction, pretreatment with several kinds of inducers has been shown to alter the expression of phase III transporters, and alter the excretion of xenobiotics, which implies that phase III transporters may also be similarly regulated in a coordinated fashion, and provides an important mean to protect the body from xenobiotics insults. It appears that in general, exposure to phase I, phase II and phase III gene inducers may trigger cellular ""stress"" response leading to the increase in their gene expression, which ultimately enhance the elimination and clearance of these xenobiotics and/or other ""cellular stresses"" including harmful reactive intermediates such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), so that the body will remove the ""stress"" expeditiously. Consequently, this homeostatic response of the body plays a central role in the protection of the body against ""environmental"" insults such as those elicited by exposure to xenobiotics.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1
8584732,A diet enriched with the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid reduces amyloid burden in an aged Alzheimer mouse model,"Epidemiological studies suggest that increased intake of the omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). DHA levels are lower in serum and brains of AD patients, which could result from low dietary intake and/or PUFA oxidation. Because effects of DHA on Alzheimer pathogenesis, particularly on amyloidosis, are unknown, we used the APPsw (Tg2576) transgenic mouse model to evaluate the impact of dietary DHA on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid burden. Aged animals (17-19 months old) were placed in one of three groups until 22.5 months of age: control (0.09% DHA), low-DHA (0%), or high-DHA (0.6%) chow. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) ELISA of the detergent-insoluble extract of cortical homogenates showed that DHA-enriched diets significantly reduced total Abeta by >70% when compared with low-DHA or control chow diets. Dietary DHA also decreased Abeta42 levels below those seen with control chow. Image analysis of brain sections with an antibody against Abeta (amino acids 1-13) revealed that overall plaque burden was significantly reduced by 40.3%, with the largest reductions (40-50%) in the hippocampus and parietal cortex. DHA modulated APP processing by decreasing both alpha- and beta-APP C-terminal fragment products and full-length APP. BACE1 (beta-secretase activity of the beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme), ApoE (apolipoprotein E), and transthyretin gene expression were unchanged with the high-DHA diet.

8584737,"[A comparative analysis of regulatory regions of the transthyretin gene in the mouse, human, and chimpanzee genomes]","A full genome analysis of differences between the gene expression in the human and chimpanzee brains revealed that the gene for transthyretin, the carrier of thyroid hormones, is differently transcribed in the cerebella of these species. A 7-kbp DNA fragment of chimpanzee was sequenced to identify possible regulatory sequences responsible for the differences in expression. One hundred and thirteen substitutions were found in the chimpanzee sequence in comparison with the human sequence. About 40% of the substitutions were revealed within the repeating elements of the genome; their location and sizes did not differ from those in the corresponding fragments of the human genome, and the nucleotide sequences had a high degree of identity. A comparison of nucleotide sequences of the transthyretin region of human, chimpanzee, and mouse genes revealed substantial differences in the distribution of G + C content along the examined fragment in the human (chimpanzee) and mouse genes and allowed us to localize three sequence tracts with a higher degree of identity in the three species. One of these tracts is located in the promoter region of the gene, and the other two probably determine the specificity of transthyretin gene expression in the liver and brain. One of the conserved tracts of the chimpanzee genome was found to have a single and a triple nucleotide substitution. The triple substitution distinguishes chimpanzees from humans and mice, which have identical sequences of this site. It is likely that these substitutions are responsible for the differences in the expression levels of the transthyretin gene in the human and chimpanzee brains.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

We aim to characterize the features of ATTR in a Taiwanese cohort of Han Chinese descent.<br /><br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Seventy-nine patients with molecularly confirmed ATTR from 57 Taiwanese families were identified by sequencing the transthyretin gene (TTR). The clinical and electrophysiological data were scrutinized. Cardiac involvement of ATTR was evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac scintigraphy. Four microsatellite and seven single-nucleotide polymorphism markers flanking TTR were genotyped to investigate the founder effect of the TTR Ala97Ser mutation.<br /><br /><strong>Results: </strong>Most of the patients had a peripheral neuropathy with variable autonomic symptoms. The average age at disease onset (AO) was 58.2 ± 7.2 years, and the male patients had an earlier AO than female patients (56.6 ± 5.7 years vs. 61.8 ± 8.9 years, P = 0.013). Electrophysiological studies revealed a generalized axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy and isolated median neuropathy in 84.5% and 15.5% of the patients, respectively. Up to 80% of the patients with ATTR had symptomatic or subclinical cardiac involvement. Six TTR mutations were identified in the participants including one novel mutation Glu89Asp. Among them, Ala97Ser was the most common mutation, accounting for 91.2% of the ATTR pedigrees. Detailed haplotype analyses demonstrated a shared haplotype in the 47 patients with the Ala97Ser mutation, suggesting a founder effect.<br /><br /><strong>Interpretation: </strong>The present study delineates the distinct features of ATTR in Taiwan and provides useful information for the diagnosis and management of ATTR, especially in patients of Chinese descent.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8592185,Putative roles of SLC7A5 (LAT1) transporter in pain,"Large amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), also known as SLC7A5, is an essential amino acid transporter that forms a heterodimeric complex with the glycoprotein cell-surface antigen heavy chain (4F2hc (CD98, SLC3A2)). Within nociceptive pathways, LAT1 is expressed in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord. Although LAT1 expression is upregulated following spinal cord injury, little is known about LAT1 in neuropathic pain. To date, only circumstantial evidence supports LAT1/4F2hc's role in pain. Notably, LAT1's expression and regulation link it to key cell types and pathways implicated in pain. Transcriptional regulation of LAT1 expression occurs via the Wnt/frizzled/β-catenin signal transduction pathway, which has been shown to be involved in chronic pain. The LAT1/4F2hc complex may also be involved in pain pathways related to T- and B-cells. LAT1's expression induces activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling axis, which is involved in inflammation and neuropathic pain. Similarly, hypoxia and cancer induce activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha, promoting not only LAT1's expression but also mTORC1's activation. Perhaps the strongest evidence linking LAT1 to pain is its interactions with key voltage-gated ion channels connected to nociception, namely the voltage-gated potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 and the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7. Through functional regulation of these channels, LAT1 may play a role in governing the excitatory to inhibitory ratio which is altered in chronic neuropathic pain states. Remarkably, the most direct role for LAT1 in pain is to mediate the influx of gabapentin and pregabalin, two first-line neuropathic pain drugs, that indirectly inhibit high voltage-activated calcium channel auxiliary subunit α2δ-1. In this review, we discuss the expression, regulation, relevant signaling pathways, and protein interactions of LAT1 that may link it to the development and/or maintenance of pain. We hypothesize that LAT1 expressed in nociceptive pathways may be a viable new target in pain.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
8592186,Three-Dimensional Explant Platform for Studies on Choroid Plexus Epithelium,"The choroid plexus (CP) plays a major role in controlling the entry of substances and immune cells into the brain as it forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) in the brain ventricles. Dysregulated immune cell trafficking through the epithelial cell (EC) layer of CP is central for the pathogenesis of infectious diseases in the brain and many neurodegenerative disorders. In vitro studies elucidating the function of the CP have so far been limited to the monolayer culture of CP ECs. To mimic immune cell migration across the CP barrier, a three-dimensional model would be advantageous. Here, we present an in vitro platform for studies of the immune cell trafficking based on CP explants/organoids. The explants were generated from fragments of mouse CPs in Matrigel, where the cells formed luminal spaces and could be maintained in culture for at least 8 weeks. We demonstrate expression of the major CP markers in the explants, including transthyretin and aquaporin 1 as well as ZO1 and ICAM-1, indicating a capacity for secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and presence of tight junctions. CP explants displayed CP-like cell polarization and formed an intact EC barrier. We also show that the expression of transthyretin, transferrin, occludin and other genes associated with various functions of CP was maintained in the explants at similar levels as in native CP. By using dendritic cells and neutrophils, we show that the migration activity of immune cells and their interactions with CP epithelium can be monitored by microscopy. Thereby, the three-dimensional CP explant model can be used to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating immune cell migration through CP epithelium and other functions of choroid EC. We propose this platform can potentially be used in the search for therapeutic targets and intervention strategies to improve control of (drug) substances and (immune) cell entry into the central nervous system.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8592191,Design and evaluation of bi-functional iron chelators for protection of dopaminergic neurons from toxicants,"While the etiology of non-familial Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear, there is evidence that increased levels of tissue iron may be a contributing factor. Moreover, exposure to some environmental toxicants is considered an additional risk factor. Therefore, brain-targeted iron chelators are of interest as antidotes for poisoning with dopaminergic toxicants, and as potential treatment of PD. We, therefore, designed a series of small molecules with high affinity for ferric iron and containing structural elements to allow their transport to the brain via the neutral amino acid transporter, LAT1 (SLC7A5). Five candidate molecules were synthesized and initially characterized for protection from ferroptosis in human neurons. The promising hydroxypyridinone SK4 was characterized further. Selective iron chelation within the physiological range of pH values and uptake by LAT1 were confirmed. Concentrations of 10-20 µM blocked neurite loss and cell demise triggered by the parkinsonian neurotoxicants, methyl-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP+) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in human dopaminergic neuronal cultures (LUHMES cells). Rescue was also observed when chelators were given after the toxicant. SK4 derivatives that either lacked LAT1 affinity or had reduced iron chelation potency showed altered activity in our assay panel, as expected. Thus, an iron chelator was developed that revealed neuroprotective properties, as assessed in several models. The data strongly support the role of iron in dopaminergic neurotoxicity and suggests further exploration of the proposed design strategy for improving brain iron chelation.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

A biomarker for the early detection and prediction for this progression is important. We recruited MCI subjects in three teaching hospitals and conducted longitudinal follow-up for 5 years at one-year intervals. Cognitively healthy controls were recruited for comparisom at baseline. Plasma transthyretin (TTR) levels were measured by ELISA. Survival analysis with time to AD conversion as an outcome variable was calculated with the multivariable Cox proportional hazards models using TTR as a continuous variable with adjustment for other covariates and bootstrapping resampling analysis. In total, 184 MCI subjects and 40 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited at baseline. At baseline, MCI patients had higher TTR levels compared with the control group. During the longitudinal follow-ups, 135 MCI patients (73.4%) completed follow-up at least once. The TTR level was an independent predictor for MCI conversion to AD when using TTR as a continuous variable (p = 0.023, 95% CI 1.001-1.007). In addition, in MCI converters, the TTR level at the point when they converted to AD was significantly lower than that at baseline (328.6 ± 66.5 vs. 381.9 ± 77.6 ug/ml, p < 0.001).

8615169,Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and dementia,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a fundamental part of the pathology of many disorders causing dementia and/or cerebral haemorrhage. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), CAA is due to the deposition of amyloid alpha protein (Abeta) within the adventitia and media of leptomeningeal and brain parenchymal arteries. Although virtually all cases of AD show CAA to a greater or lesser extent, the brain distribution of CAA is not uniform with the occipital lobe being the most commonly and most severely affected region. In vessels affected by CAA, local muscle and elastic elements are lost and replaced by amyloid fibrils, thereby weakening the overall structure of the vessel. Consequently, CAA predisposes towards cerebral infarction and cerebral haemorrhage, though the clinical affects of CAA in AD are mostly silent, or at least are ''masked'' by the greater degree of neuronal dysfunction induced by senile plaque (SP) formation and neurofibrillary degeneration. Nonetheless, major cerebral infarctions with focal neurological deficits can occur in some cases of AD, and CAA is a major cause of fatal intracerebral (lobar) haemorrhage. CAA may also contribute to white matter lesions (myelin loss) in AD by inducing ischaemia through autoregulatory dysfunction. Although the Abeta protein deposited within blood vessels in AD is similar in chemical composition to that deposited in the brain parenchyma in SP, there is no clear relationship between the 2 pathologies. Indeed, when CAA is high, SP formation may be low, and vice versa. As if to emphasise these differences, Abeta within CAA is mostly Abeta40 whereas that within SP is Abeta42. Such compositional differences may reflect differences in source, with Abeta in SP being derived from nerve cells and Abeta in CAA having a local vascular origin. Although certain inherited forms of CAA with cerebral haemorrhage are associated with autosomal dominant mutations in APP and other genes (cystatin-C, transthyretin, gelsolin, ABrit, ADan), in most cases of AD CAA does not associate clearly with any genetic risk factor other than APO E beta4 allele, which appears to increase the severity of CAA in a dose dependent manner, especially within the occipital cortex. Genotype/phenotype correlations may be helpful in understanding the development of CAA in AD and other disorders. Why blood vessels in the occipital lobe should be most susceptible to CAA in AD remains unclear, though this pattern of blood vessel involvement does not seem to be recapitulated in other disorders in which CAA is the principal pathological change.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8584550,Unique biochemical nature of carp retinol-binding protein. N-linked glycosylation and uncleavable NH2-terminal signal peptide,"Retinol transport and metabolism have been well characterized in mammals; however, very little is known in fish. To study the mechanism by which fish retinol-binding protein (RBP) is able to remain in plasma besides its small molecular size, we isolated RBP cDNA from a carp liver cDNA library. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with that of known vertebrate RBPs showed that carp RBP has high homology to the other cloned vertebrate RBPs, but it lacks the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide, RNL(S)L, which is most likely involved in the interaction with transthyretin in mammalian RBPs. In addition, the primary structure of carp RBP contains two consensus N-linked glycosylation sites that represent a unique feature. We have obtained experimental evidence, by in vitro and in vivo expression experiments, that both sites are indeed glycosylated. We have also characterized the protein as a complex type N-linked glycoprotein by lectin binding assay, neuraminidase and endoglycosidase H and F digestion. Inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin treatment of transfected cells caused a great reduction of RBP secretion. Since kidney filtration of anionic proteins is less than half that of neutral protein of the same size, this finding strongly suggests that the amount of carp RBP filtration through kidney glomeruli may be reduced by a glycosylation-dependent increase in the molecular size and negative charge of the protein. A second unique feature of carp RBP as secretory protein is the presence of a nonconserved NH(2)-terminal hydrophobic domain, which functions as an insertion signal but is not cleaved cotranslationally and remains in the secreted RBP.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

8592376,Large Amino Acid Transporter 1 Selective Liposomes of l-DOPA Functionalized Amphiphile for Combating Glioblastoma,"Despite significant progress in neurosurgery and radiation therapy during the past decade, overall survivability (OS) of glioblastoma patients continues to be less than 2 years. The scope of systemic chemotherapy is greatly limited by poor drug transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and, thereby, suboptimal drug accumulation in glioma tissue. To this end, use of large amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1) overexpressed both on brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) and glioma cells has begun. Prior reports on the use of LAT1 mediated delivery of model drugs showed their brain accumulations. However, in depth in vivo glioblastoma regression studies aimed at examining the therapeutic potential of LAT1 mediated delivery of potent chemotherapeutics to brain tumor tissues have not yet been undertaken. Herein, we report on the development of a nanometric (100-135 nm) promising LAT1 selective liposomal drug carrier prepared from a novel l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) functionalized amphiphile (Amphi-DOPA). In vitro studies using Rh-PE labeled liposomes of Amphi-DOPA both in untreated glioma (GL261) cells and in GL261cells preincubated with LAT1 antibody revealed LAT1 mediated cellular uptake. Intravenously administered NIR-dye labeled liposomes of Amphi-DOPA in glioblastoma-bearing mice showed preferential accumulation of the dye in brain tissue. Notably iv administration of WP1066-loaded liposomes of Amphi-DOPA enhanced the overall survivability of C57BL/6J mice bearing orthotopically established mouse glioblastoma by ∼60% compared to that for the untreated mouse group. Furthermore, we show that the OS of established glioblastoma-bearing mice can be significantly enhanced (by >300% compared to that for the untreated mouse group) when the presently described LAT1 mediated targeted chemotherapy with WP1066-loaded liposomes of Amphi-DOPA is combined with in vivo DC-targeted DNA vaccination using a survivin (a glioblastoma antigen) encoded DNA vaccine.

8592379,Diagnostic utility of cardiac troponin T level in patients with cardiac amyloidosis,"<strong>AIM: </strong>The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels in discriminating cardiac amyloidosis from patients with cardiac hypertrophy caused by aetiologies other than cardiac amyloidosis.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>Serum hs-cTnT levels were measured in 96 patients with cardiac amyloidosis (light chain: 23, wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis: 40, and mutated transthyretin amyloidosis: 33), and 91 patients with other causes of cardiac hypertrophy who were confirmed to have no cardiac amyloidosis by endomyocardial biopsy (control group). The diagnostic utility and cut-off value of hs-cTnT were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The median hs-cTnT levels were higher in cardiac amyloidosis than the control group [0.048 (0.029-0.073) vs. 0.016 (0.010-0.031) ng/mL; P < 0.001]. High levels of hs-cTnT were suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis (cut-off value: 0.0312 ng/mL, sensitivity: 0.74, specificity: 0.76, area under the curve: 0.788; 95% confidence interval: 0.723-0.854, P < 0.001), compared with brain natriuretic peptide and E/e' ratio. The hs-cTnT levels were also useful in differentiating each type of amyloidosis from the control group. Multivariate analysis identified log hs-cTnT as an independent diagnostic factor for cardiac amyloidosis (odds ratio: 2.22; 95% confidence interval: 1.30-3.80; P = 0.004).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>High serum levels of hs-cTnT are highly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis, allowing its differentiation from cardiac hypertrophy of other aetiologies.

8592385,Abnormal expression of homeobox genes and transthyretin in C9ORF72 expansion carriers,"<strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>We performed a genome-wide brain expression study to reveal the underpinnings of diseases linked to a repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72).<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The genome-wide expression profile was investigated in brain tissue obtained from C9ORF72 expansion carriers (n = 32), patients without this expansion (n = 30), and controls (n = 20). Using quantitative real-time PCR, findings were confirmed in our entire pathologic cohort of expansion carriers (n = 56) as well as nonexpansion carriers (n = 31) and controls (n = 20).<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Our findings were most profound in the cerebellum, where we identified 40 differentially expressed genes, when comparing expansion carriers to patients without this expansion, including 22 genes that have a homeobox (e.g., HOX genes) and/or are located within the HOX gene cluster (top hit: homeobox A5 [HOXA5]). In addition to the upregulation of multiple homeobox genes that play a vital role in neuronal development, we noticed an upregulation of transthyretin (TTR), an extracellular protein that is thought to be involved in neuroprotection. Pathway analysis aligned with these findings and revealed enrichment for gene ontology processes involved in (anatomic) development (e.g., organ morphogenesis). Additional analyses uncovered that HOXA5 and TTR levels are associated with C9ORF72 variant 2 levels as well as with intron-containing transcript levels, and thus, disease-related changes in those transcripts may have triggered the upregulation of HOXA5 and TTR.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>In conclusion, our identification of genes involved in developmental processes and neuroprotection sheds light on potential compensatory mechanisms influencing the occurrence, presentation, and/or progression of C9ORF72-related diseases.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8608554,Correlation of F-18-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosin uptake with vascular and cell density in non-contrast-enhancing gliomas,"<strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>Even without contrast enhancement on MRI scans gliomas can show histological features of anaplasia. These tumors are heterogeneous regarding anaplastic and non-anaplastic areas. Increased amino acid uptake was shown to be associated with dismal prognosis in gliomas. We investigated histological correlates of tumor grading in biopsies obtained from regions with maximum amino acid uptake revealed by F-18-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosin positron emission tomography (FET-PET).<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>We included 22 patients with non-contrast enhancing lesions on MRI scans. PET was performed 10 min after FET injection, and the area of maximum FET uptake was chosen as the biopsy target. In 13 patients neuronavigated biopsies were obtained during tumor resection. Nine patients had a stereotactic biopsy. The ratio of maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) to background was calculated. Histological specimens were classified and graded according to world health organization (WHO) criteria. We investigated cell and vascular density, mitotic activity, proliferation index, microvascular proliferation, nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis and immunoreactivity of LAT1 (SLC7A5), an amino acid transporter with prognostic impact in gliomas.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>12 of the 22 non-contrast enhancing gliomas corresponded to anaplastic astrocytomas WHO grade III. Vascular and cellular density was correlated highly to the SUV ratio (P = 0.0015 and P = 0.0021, respectively), but with no nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, Mib-1 immunoreactivity, or microvascular proliferation. Thus, no correlation was found between FET uptake and tumor grade.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>FET-PET correlates with vascular and cell density in non-contrast enhancing gliomas. Although tumor grade cannot be predicted, clinical use of FET PET as an indicator for neovascularization should be addressed in future studies.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8608551,Preferred transport of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-D-tyrosine (D-FET) into the porcine brain,"Amino acids are valuable tracers for brain tumor imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). In this study the transport of O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-D-tyrosine (D-FET) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was studied with PET in anesthetized piglets and patients after subtotal resection of brain tumors and compared with O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (L-FET) and 3-O-methyl-6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-DOPA (L-OMFD). In piglets, compartmental modeling of PET data was used to calculate the rate constants for the blood-brain (K(1)) and the brain-blood (k(2)) transfer of D-FET, L-FET and L-OMFD. In patients standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated in brain cortex and lesions. Additionally, affinity determinations on various amino acid transporters (LAT1, LAT2, PAT1, XPCT) were performed in vitro using unlabeled D-FET, L-FET and L-OMFD. The initial brain uptake of D-FET in piglets was more than two-fold higher than that of l-FET, whereas the initial brain uptake of D-FET in patients was similar to that of L-FET. Calculation of K(1) and k(2) from the brain uptake curves and the plasma input data in piglets revealed about 4- and 2-fold higher values for D-FET compared to L-FET and L-OMFD, respectively. The distribution volume of D-FET in the piglet brain was slightly higher than that of L-FET as it was also found for most other organs. In brain tumor patients, initial D-FET uptake in the brain was similar to that of L-FET but showed faster tracer washout. L-FET uptake remained rather constant and provided a better delineation of residual tumor than D-FET. In conclusion, our data indicate considerable differences of stereoselective amino acid transport at the BBB in different species. Therefore, the results from animal experiments concerning BBB amino acid transport may not be transferable to humans.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

We report a 31-year-old female patient with thyrotoxic HE whose daughter has been followed up with the same diagnosis. Suboptimal response was observed with intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasmapheresis. Reduction of the anti-thyroid auto-antibody concentrations marked the patient's improvement in each episode. She relapsed under oral immunosuppressive therapy. After removing the thyroid tissue, full recovery has been achieved for the last 18 months. These data may contribute to clarification of the pathogenetic role of anti-thyroid antibodies in HE. Thyroidectomy can be considered as one of the treatment options especially in thyrotoxic HE patients with uncontrolled relapses. Our patient is the first reported HE case with a family history.

The patient was a 49-year-old woman with V30M transthyretin (TTR) variant (p.TTRV50M), who underwent ophthalmectomy due to corneal rupture 10 years after liver transplantation (LT). The amyloid was selectively isolated from several portions in intra- and extraocular tissues using a laser microdissection (LMD) system and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine the composition percentage of wild-type and variant TTR in the isolated amyloid. Biochemical analysis revealed that the amyloid consisted mainly of variant TTR in intraocular tissues with a percentage > 80%. On the contrary in the extraocular muscles, wild-type TTR was the main component of the amyloid with a percentage of ∼70%. Our data indicate that intraocular amyloid formation strongly depends on locally synthesized variant TTR and the contribution of wild-type TTR to amyloid formation is quite limited.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The LAT1 protein is expressed in different tissues, including kidney, blood brain barrier and intestinal wall hence LAT1 can be used as a target in diseases associated with its overexpression. In-silico interactions between different ligands, including methionine (Met), N-acetyl-l-methionine (AcMet), hyaluronic acid (HA), grafted hyaluronic-acid l-methionine (HA-ADH-Met) and a novel grafted hyaluronic acid-N-acetyl-l-methionine (HA-ADH-AcMet), which are at the active site of the LAT1 transporter, were studied and the binding energies calculated. The HA-ADH-AcMet complex demonstrated binding energy and solvation energy of -74.84 and 81.46 kcal/mol, respectively, thus validating its potential to be synthesized. The structural conformation of the HA-ADH-AcMet was confirmed using 1H NMR, FTIR, DSC and PXRD. Microscale thermophoresis was employed to study the binding affinity between the different ligands and LAT1. The binding affinity was expressed in terms of a dissociation constant (Kd), where that of HA-ADH-AcMet was found to be 408 nM which was considered the strongest among the different ligands tested.

8592695,Calorie Restriction Suppresses Age-Dependent Hippocampal Transcriptional Signatures,"Calorie restriction (CR) enhances longevity and mitigates aging phenotypes in numerous species. Physiological responses to CR are cell-type specific and variable throughout the lifespan. However, the mosaic of molecular changes responsible for CR benefits remains unclear, particularly in brain regions susceptible to deterioration during aging. We examined the influence of long-term CR on the CA1 hippocampal region, a key learning and memory brain area that is vulnerable to age-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Through mRNA sequencing and NanoString nCounter analysis, we demonstrate that one year of CR feeding suppresses age-dependent signatures of 882 genes functionally associated with synaptic transmission-related pathways, including calcium signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and Creb signaling in wild-type mice. By comparing the influence of CR on hippocampal CA1 region transcriptional profiles at younger-adult (5 months, 2.5 months of feeding) and older-adult (15 months, 12.5 months of feeding) timepoints, we identify conserved upregulation of proteome quality control and calcium buffering genes, including heat shock 70 kDa protein 1b (Hspa1b) and heat shock 70 kDa protein 5 (Hspa5), protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4 (Pdia4) and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 6 (Pdia6), and calreticulin (Calr). Expression levels of putative neuroprotective factors, klotho (Kl) and transthyretin (Ttr), are also elevated by CR in adulthood, although the global CR-specific expression profiles at younger and older timepoints are highly divergent. At a previously unachieved resolution, our results demonstrate conserved activation of neuroprotective gene signatures and broad CR-suppression of age-dependent hippocampal CA1 region expression changes, indicating that CR functionally maintains a more youthful transcriptional state within the hippocampal CA1 sector.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Several products of neurotransmitter genes and neuromodulator genes (which play important parts in mediating and maintaining cognitive ability as a function of age) are expressed in hippocampal formation. However, they represent only a small fraction of genes known to be expressed in this region. We review here recent studies on the use of cDNA microarray and proteomic approaches to uncover novel genes and pathways that might be involved in cognitive processes in the aged brain. We and other authors have demonstrated major individual differences in cognitive ability in rats of a similar age, thereby making it possible to directly compare gene products expressed as a function of age and cognitive status.

For this reason, even cell culture experiments have often be performed with unphysiological protein-free media. The aim of this study was to evaluate the recovery of exogenous T1AM added to a standard cell culture medium, namely Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS), and to other biological matrixes. Methods: Cell culture media (Krebs-Ringer buffer, DMEM, FBS, DMEM + FBS, used either in the absence or in the presence of NG108-15 cells) and other biological matrixes (rat brain and liver homogenates, human plasma, and blood) were spiked with T1AM and/or deuterated T1AM (d4-T1AM) and incubated for times ranging from 0 to 240 minutes. Samples were then extracted using a liquid/liquid method and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in order to assay T1AM and its metabolites, namely 3-iodothyroacetic acid (TA1), thyronamine, thyroacetic acid, N-acetyl-T1AM, and T1AM esters. Results: In FBS-containing buffers, T1AM decreased exponentially over time, with a half-life of 6-17 minutes, depending on FBS content, and after 60 minutes, it averaged 0-10% of the baseline. T1AM metabolites were not detected, except for minimum amounts of TA1. Notably, d4-T1AM decreased over time at a much lower rate, reaching 50-70% of the baseline at 60 minutes. These effects were completely abolished by protein denaturation and partly reduced by semicarbazide. In the presence of cells, T1AM concentration decreased virtually to 0 within 60 minutes, but TA1 accumulated in the incubation medium, with quantitative recovery. Spontaneous decrease in T1AM concentration with isotopic difference was confirmed in rat organ homogenates and human blood. Conclusions: These results suggest binding and sequestration of T1AM and/or its aldehyde derivative by blood and tissue proteins, with significant isotope effects.

To achieve this, either unilateral or bilateral intranigral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was performed. CSF proteins were first analyzed either by 2D electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF at days 1 and 10 after the lesion to discern between potential prognosis and diagnosis protein markers. Most significant changes from this analysis were early increases of haptoglobin, transthyretin and different spots further identified as prostaglandin D synthase in response to LPS. These markers were then analyzed by western blotting in CSF and plasma using specific antibodies from samples obtained in animals receiving either LPS in substantia nigra or hippocampus and 6-OHDA in the medial forebrain bundle.

In this cross-sectional study we tested whether long-term and/or short-term use of wireless telephones was associated with changes in the serum transthyretin level, indicating altered transthyretin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, possibly reflecting an effect of radiation.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>One thousand subjects, 500 of each sex aged 18-65 years, were randomly recruited using the population registry. Data on wireless telephone use were assessed by a postal questionnaire and blood samples were analyzed for serum transthyretin concentrations determined by standard immunonephelometric techniques on a BN Prospec instrument.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The response rate was 31.4%. Logistic regression of dichotomized TTR serum levels with a cut-point of 0.31 g/l on wireless telephone use yielded increased odds ratios that were statistically not significant. Linear regression of time since first use overall and on the day that blood was withdrawn gave different results for males and females: for men significantly higher serum concentrations of TTR were seen the longer an analogue telephone or a mobile and cordless desktop telephone combined had been used, and in contrast, significantly lower serum levels were seen the longer an UMTS telephone had been used. Adjustment for fractions of use of the different telephone types did not modify the effect for cumulative use or years since first use for mobile telephone and DECT, combined. For women, linear regression gave a significant association for short-term use of mobile and cordless telephones combined, indicating that the sooner blood was withdrawn after the most recent telephone call, the higher the expected transthyretin concentration.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>In this hypothesis-generating descriptive study time since first use of mobile telephones and DECT combined was significantly associated with higher TTR levels regardless of how much each telephone type had been used.

8608507,"The SLC16A family of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs)--physiology and function in cellular metabolism, pH homeostasis, and fluid transport","The SLC16A family of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) is composed of 14 members. MCT1 through MCT4 (MCTs 1-4) are H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporters, MCT8 and MCT10 transport thyroid hormone and aromatic amino acids, while the substrate specificity and function of other MCTs have yet to be determined. The focus of this review is on MCTs 1-4 because their role in lactate transport is intrinsically linked to cellular metabolism in various biological systems, including skeletal muscle, brain, retina, and testis. Although MCTs 1-4 all transport lactate, they differ in their transport kinetics and vary in tissue and subcellular distribution, where they facilitate ""lactate-shuttling"" between glycolytic and oxidative cells within tissues and across blood-tissue barriers. However, the role of MCTs 1-4 is not confined to cellular metabolism. By interacting with bicarbonate transport proteins and carbonic anhydrases, MCTs participate in the regulation of pH homeostasis and fluid transport in renal proximal tubule and corneal endothelium, respectively. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of MCTs 1-4, linking their cellular distribution to their functions in various parts of the human body, so that we can better understand the physiological roles of MCTs at the systemic level.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8633020,Molecules important for thyroid hormone synthesis and action - known facts and future perspectives,"Thyroid hormones are of crucial importance for the functioning of nearly every organ. Remarkably, disturbances of thyroid hormone synthesis and function are among the most common endocrine disorders affecting approximately one third of the working German population. Over the last ten years our understanding of biosynthesis and functioning of these hormones has increased tremendously. This includes the identification of proteins involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis like Thox2 and Dehal where mutations in these genes are responsible for certain degrees of hypothyroidism. One of the most important findings was the identification of a specific transporter for triiodothyronine (T3), the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) responsible for directed transport of T3 into target cells and for export of thyroid hormones out of thyroid epithelial cells. Genetic disturbances of MCT8 in patients result in a biochemical constellation of high T3 levels in combination with low or normal TSH and thyroxine levels leading to a new syndrome of severe X-linked mental retardation. Importantly mice lacking MCT8 presented only with a mild phenotype, indicating that compensatory mechanisms exist in mice. Moreover, it has become clear that not only genomic actions of T3 exist. T3 is also capable to activate adhesion receptors and it signals via activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways. Most recently, thyroid hormone derivatives were identified, the thyronamines which are decarboxylated thyroid hormones initiating physiological actions like lowering body temperature and heart rate, thereby acting in opposite direction to the classical thyroid hormones. So far it is believed that thyronamines function via the activation of a G-protein coupled receptor, TAAR1.

8592977,Effect of MK-801 on gene expressions in the amygdala of rats,"Rodents treated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists have been thought to be an animal model of schizophrenia. In this study, we examined gene expression in the amygdala of rats chronically treated with MK-801, as well as behavioral changes, such as social behavior, in these animals. The social interaction test, a measure of social behavior, and locomotor activity was performed in male Wistar rats injected with MK-801 (0.13 mg/kg i.p.) or saline for 14 days. Changes in mRNA levels were analyzed using a GeneChip microarray system. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay was subsequently conducted to confirm the results of the microarray analysis. MK-801 decreased social interaction and increased locomotor activity in rats, consistent with previous reports. We found 23 downregulated genes and 16 upregulated genes, with the gene encoding arginine-vasopressin (AVP) being most downregulated, and that for transthyretin (Ttr) most upregulated. mRNA levels, quantified by RT-qPCR assay, were altered for genes related to neuropeptides (AVP, Sstr2), the arachidonic cascade (Ptgds), myelination (Mobp, Enpp2), neurotrophic factors (Igfbp2), and hormonal milieu (Ttr). Downregulation of the AVP gene in the amygdala of MK-801-treated rats may provide a basis for the ability of AVP-analogues to ameliorate the behavioral disturbances caused by blockade of the NMDA receptor.

8632185,Triiodothyronine modulates neuronal plasticity mechanisms to enhance functional outcome after stroke,"The development of new therapeutic approaches for stroke patients requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that enhance recovery of lost neurological functions. The efficacy to enhance homeostatic mechanisms during the first weeks after stroke will influence functional outcome. Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential regulators of neuronal plasticity, however, their role in recovery related mechanisms of neuronal plasticity after stroke remains unknown. This study addresses important findings of 3,5,3 '-triiodo-L-thyronine (T-3) in the regulation of homeostatic mechanisms that adjust excitability - inhibition ratio in the post-ischemic brain. This is valid during the first 2 weeks after experimental stroke induced by photothrombosis (PT) and in cultured neurons subjected to an in vitro model of acute cerebral ischemia. In the human post-stroke brain, we assessed the expression pattern of TH receptors (TR) protein levels, important for mediating T-3 actions. Our results show that T-3 modulates several plasticity mechanisms that may operate on different temporal and spatial scales as compensatory mechanisms to assure appropriate synaptic neurotransmission. We have shown in vivo that long-term administration of T-3 after PT significantly (1) enhances lost sensorimotor function; (2) increases levels of synaptotagmin 1&2 and levels of the post-synaptic GluR2 subunit in AMPA receptors in the peri-infarct area; (3) increases dendritic spine density in the peri-infarct and contralateral region and (4) decreases tonic GABAergic signaling in the peri-infarct area by a reduced number of parvalbumin(+) / c-fos(+) neurons and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 levels. In addition, we have shown that T-3 modulates in vitro neuron membrane properties with the balance of inward glutamate ligand-gated channels currents and decreases synaptotagmin levels in conditions of deprived oxygen and glucose. Interestingly, we found increased levels of TR beta 1 in the infarct core of post-mortem human stroke patients, which mediate T-3 actions. Summarizing, our data identify T-3 as a potential key therapeutic agent to enhance recovery of lost neurological functions after ischemic stroke.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8593086,Increased protein glycation in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease,"Accumulation of advanced glycation end products occurs in the brain with ageing and was proposed to be involved in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We studied changes in the level of an early glycation product, an Amadori product, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in ageing and in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The work was carried out on 99 consecutive patients. The concentration of Amadori product in CSF correlated with CSF glucose concentration but was not changed with age (n = 70). In contrast, level of CSF Amadori product was 1.7-fold higher in Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 29) as compared with non-demented age-matched control group (n = 20; P < 0.0005), although CSF glucose concentration was similar in both groups (4.1 +/- 1.3 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/liter, resp.). An increased accumulation of Amadori products was found in all major proteins of CSF of Alzheimer's disease including albumin, apolipoprotein E and transthyretin. We propose that the increased early glycation of CSF proteins in the Alzheimer's patients may stimulate the formation and the consequent deposition of advanced glycation end products as well as oxidative stress in the brain.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8593135,A new in vitro model for blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier transport studies: an immortalized choroid plexus epithelial cell line derived from the tsA58 SV40 large T-antigen gene transgenic rat,"The blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) plays a key role in the influx and efflux transport of drugs and endogenous substrates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To clarify the molecular mechanism of the BCSFB transport system, a new in vitro BCSFB model, i.e. an immortalized rat choroid plexus epithelial cell line (TR-CSFB), has been established from transgenic rats harboring a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen gene. TR-CSFB cells grow well at 33 degrees C because of activation of the temperature-sensitive large T-antigen. These cells have a polygonal epithelial cell morphology and express typical choroid plexus epithelial cell markers, such as transthyretin (TTR) and Na+, K+ -ATPase, as well as the transporters, system A and ABCC1/mrp1. The localization of Na+, K+ -ATPase, and the transport direction of system A are polarized in TR-CSFB cells as is the case in vivo. TR-CSFB cells exhibit L-proline and L-glutamic acid uptake activities and may reflect the CSF-to-blood efflux transport functions involving these amino acids in vivo. Using TR-CSFB cells, we found for the first time that oatp3 is expressed at the BCSFB. TR-CSFB cells appear to be a useful in vitro model of the BCSFB for the study of drug transport, BCSFB transporters, and the regulation of BCSFB functions.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8632184,Effect of BRAF mutational status on expression profiles in conventional papillary thyroid carcinomas,"Background: Whereas 40 % to 70 % of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) are characterized by a BRAF mutation (BRAF(mut)), unified biomarkers for the genetically heterogeneous group of BRAF wild type (BRAF(wt)) PTCs are not established yet. Using state-of-the-art technology we compared RNA expression profiles between conventional BRAF(wt) and BRAF(mut) PTCs. Methods: Microarrays covering 36,079 reference sequences were used to generate whole transcript expression profiles in 11 BRAF(wt) PTCs including five micro PTCs, 14 BRAF(mut) PTCs, and 7 normal thyroid specimens. A p-value with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a fold change > 2 were used as a threshold of significance for differential expression. Network and pathway utilities were employed to interpret significance of expression data. BRAF mutational status was established by direct sequencing the hotspot region of exon 15. Results: We identified 237 annotated genes that were significantly differentially expressed between BRAF(wt) and BRAF(mut) PTCs. Of these, 110 genes were down-and 127 were upregulated in BRAF(wt) compared to BRAF(mut) PTCs. A number of molecules involved in thyroid hormone metabolism including thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were differentially expressed between both groups. Among cancer-associated molecules were ERBB3 that was downregulated and ERBB4 that was upregulated in BRAF(wt) PTCs. Two microRNAs were significantly differentially expressed of which miR492 bears predicted functions relevant to thyroid-specific molecules. The protein kinase A (PKA) and the G protein-coupled receptor pathways were identified as significantly related signaling cascades to the gene set of 237 genes. Furthermore, a network of interacting molecules was predicted on basis of the differentially expressed gene set. Conclusions: The expression study focusing on affected genes that are differentially expressed between BRAF(wt) and BRAF(mut) conventional PTCs identified a number of molecules which are connected in a network and affect important canonical pathways. The identified gene set adds to our understanding of the tumor biology of BRAF(wt) and BRAF(mut) PTCs and contains genes/biomarkers of interest.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8632183,Memantine prodrug as a new agent for Alzheimer's Disease,"Hydrogen sulphide has recently drawn much attention due to its potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective roles in brain functions. The purpose of the current study was to exploit these beneficial properties of H2S to design a new agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To pursue our aims, we replaced the free amine group of memantine with an isothiocyanate functionality as a putative H2S-donor moiety. The new chemical entity, named memit, was then tested in vitro to determine whether it retains the pharmacological profile of the ""native drug"", while also providing a source of H2S in the CNS. Indeed, Memit showed the ability to release H2S through a cysteine-mediated mechanism, thus generating memantine. Moreover, the new hybrid molecule exerts protective effects against neuronal inflammation and induces a drastic fall in ROS production. In addition, memit was also able to reduce the A beta(1-42) self-induced aggregation and exerted cytoprotective effect against A beta oligomers-induced damage in both human neurons and rat microglia cells. Finally, similarly to memantine, the new compound promotes autophagy, a complex process required for cellular homeostasis in cell survival that results to be altered in neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, our study revealed that memit is a prodrug of memantine. Further in vivo studies will be necessary to fully investigate the synergic or cumulative effects due to the H2S-releasing moiety and the native drug.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8592715,[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy with familial transthyretin-derived oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis],"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is caused by the accumulation of amyloid fibrils on vascular walls and is a well-known cause of cerebral hemorrhages in the elderly. This disease manifests as recurrent or multiple simultaneous subcortical hematomas, occasionally leading to fatal hemorrhages. Additionally, it is noteworthy that CAA-related hemorrhages can develop in individuals aged around 50 years. Although a few different amyloid fibril proteins have been isolated from patients with CAA, the most common protein is Aβ, which is also the main component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have suggested that corticosteroid therapy is effective for preventing the recurrence of CAA-related hemorrhages. Hereditary generalized amyloidosis usually manifests as familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), showing severe involvement of peripheral somatic and autonomic nerves. Many variant forms of transthyretin (TTR) with a single amino acid substitution have been identified as causative amyloid precursor proteins in FAP. Moreover, a small number of TTR gene mutations causes a rare phenotype of systemic amyloidosis characterized by preferential deposition of TTR-derived amyloid proteins in the vitreous body in the eye, as well as the leptomeninges and subarachnoidal vessels in the central nervous system (CNS). This disorder is called familial oculoleptomeningeal or leptomeningeal amyloidosis and is characterized clinically by CNS symptoms, including progressive dementia, seizures, ataxia, spastic paresis, and stroke-like episodes. Since the variant forms of TTR in this amyloidosis are derived from the retinal epithelium or choroid plexus, liver transplantation-an effective treatment for FAP-is considered less effective for treating this rare form of TTR-related systemic amyloidosis.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

In this case, the difference in the transcription levels of the gene encoding the protein transthyretin (Ttr) expression in rats under the pathological conditions of ischemia and in the presence of Semax was very high. High similarity between the effects of Ttr and coupled molecular systems with the Semax effects in ischemic stroke allowed us to suggest that the neuroprotection mechanisms of Semax (and, possibly, of other neuroprotection mechanisms of Semax) could be mediated by Ttr.

The expression of drug transporters is associated with microRNAs. We previously revealed that miR-23a-3p levels were elevated in the blood of patients with intractable epilepsy. Additionally, the influx drug transporter organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2 (Oatp2) is involved in the intracerebral transport of valproic acid (VPA), the most commonly used AED; repeated seizures lead to decreased expression of Oatp2. However, the role of miR-23a-3p in the expression of Oatp2 and in the development of drug resistance has not been established. Herein, we aimed to determine the potential role of miR-23a-3p in VPA-resistant epilepsy through in vivo and in vitro experiments.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Epilepsy was elicited after status epilepticus (SE) was induced by lithium-pilocarpine in adult Sprague-Dawley rats, followed by VPA treatment to select rats with VPA resistance. The expression of miR-23a-3p was detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A miR-23a-3p inhibitor was intracerebrally injected into VPA-resistant rats, and histological staining and Morris water maze tests were performed to evaluate brain damage and learning/memory functions in these rats. Subsequently, a dual-luciferase reporter assay and a VPA uptake assay were performed in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) to investigate the underlying mechanism of action of miR-23a-3p.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Our results indicated that compared to that in control rats, miR-23a-3p was elevated in VPA-resistant rats. Intracerebral injection of a miR-23a-3p inhibitor reduced brain damage and the associated deficits in learning and memory functions in rats with VPA resistance. Further investigation indicated that Oatp2 was the direct target of miR-23a-3p, and it was negatively regulated by miR-23a-3p in the brain and BMECs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-23a-3p reduced VPA uptake in BMECs by regulating Oatp2 expression.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>miR-23a-3p is involved in VPA resistance in epilepsy by directly targeting the influx drug transporter Oatp2, indicating that miR-23a-3p could be a potential therapeutic target for intractable epilepsy.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Immunoreactivities of A beta and A beta 40 were found both in the proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells. But the immunolocalization of A beta 40 was observed predominantly in the distal tubules whereas that of A beta 42 was predominantly recognized in the proximal tubules. TTR, sequestrating protein for A beta, was present in the proximal tubules. The mechanism by which A beta does not form amyloid in Alzheimer's disease outside the brain remains unknown.

One-year-old APP/PS2 mice with high brain levels of Abeta and abundant Abeta plaques show disturbances in spatial learning and memory. Treatment of these deteriorated mice with a systemic slow-release formulation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) significantly ameliorated AD-like disturbances. Thus, IGF-I enhanced cognitive performance, decreased brain Abeta load, increased the levels of synaptic proteins, and reduced astrogliosis associated to Abeta plaques. The beneficial effects of IGF-I were associated to a significant increase in brain Abeta complexed to protein carriers such as albumin, apolipoprotein J or transthyretin. Since levels of APP were not modified after IGF-I therapy, and in vitro data showed that IGF-I increases the transport of Abeta/carrier protein complexes through the choroid plexus barrier, it seems that IGF-I favors elimination of Abeta from the brain, supporting a therapeutic use of this growth factor in AD.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

8625173,"Retinoid receptors, transporters, and metabolizers as therapeutic targets in late onset Alzheimer disease","Vitamin A (retinoid) is required in the adult brain to enable cognition, learning, and memory. While brain levels of retinoid diminish over the course of normal ageing, retinoid deficit is greater in late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) brains than in normal-aged controls. This paper reviews recent evidence supporting these statements and further suggests that genes necessary for the synthesis, transport and function of retinoid to and within the ageing brain are appropriate targets for treatment of LOAD. These genes tend to be clustered with genes that have been proposed as candidates in LOAD, are found at chromosomal regions linked to LOAD, and suggest the possibility of an overall coordinated regulation. This phenomenon is termed Chromeron and is analogous to the operon mechanism observed in prokaryotes. Suggested treatment targets are the retinoic-acid inactivating enzymes (CYP26)s, the retinol binding and transport proteins, retinol-binding protein (RBP)4 and transthyretin (TTR), and the retinoid receptors. TTR as a LOAD target is the subject of active investigation. The retinoid receptors and the retinoid-inactivating enzymes have previously been proposed as targets. This is the first report to suggest that RBP4 is an amenable treatment target in LOAD. RBP4 is elevated in type-2 diabetes and obesity, conditions associated with increased risk for LOAD. Fenretinide, a novel synthetic retinoic acid (RA) analog lowers RBP4 in glucose intolerant obese mice.

8627687,Molecular Variants in Human Trace Amine-Associated Receptors and Their Implications in Mental and Metabolic Disorders,"We provide a comprehensive review of the available evidence on the pathophysiological implications of genetic variants in the human trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) superfamily. Genes coding for trace amine-associated receptors (taars) represent a multigene family of G-protein-coupled receptors, clustered to a small genomic region of 108 kb located in chromosome 6q23, which has been consistently identified by linkage analyses as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and affective disorders. Most TAARs are expressed in brain areas involved in emotions, reward and cognition. TAARs are activated by endogenous trace amines and thyronamines, and evidence for a modulatory action on other monaminergic systems has been reported. Therefore, linkage analyses were followed by fine mapping association studies in schizophrenia and affective disorders. However, none of these reports has received sufficient universal replication, so their status remains uncertain. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in taars have emerged as susceptibility loci from genome-wide association studies investigating migraine and brain development, but none of the detected variants reached the threshold for genome-wide significance. In the last decade, technological advances enabled single-gene or whole-exome sequencing, thus allowing the detection of rare genetic variants, which may have a greater impact on the risk of complex disorders. Using these approaches, several taars (especially taar1) variants have been detected in patients with mental and metabolic disorders, and in some cases, defective receptor function has been demonstrated in vitro. Finally, with the use of transcriptomic and peptidomic techniques, dysregulations of TAARs (especially TAAR6) have been identified in brain disorders characterized by cognitive impairment.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
8627688,Novel thyroid hormones,"The field of thyroid hormone signaling has grown more complex in recent years. In particular, it has been suggested that some thyroid hormone derivatives, tentatively named ""novel thyroid hormones"" or ""active thyroid hormone metabolites"", may act as independent chemical messengers. They include 3,5-diiodothyronine (T2), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), and several iodothyroacetic acids, i.e., 3,5,3',5'-thyroacetic acid (TA4), 3,5,3'-thyroacetic acid (TA3), and 3-thyroacetic acid (TA1). We summarize the present knowledge on these compounds, namely their biosynthetic pathways, endogenous levels, molecular targets, and the functional effects elicited in experimental preparations or intact animals after exogenous administration. Their physiological and pathophysiological role is discussed, and potential therapeutic applications are outlined. The requirements needed to qualify these substances as chemical messengers must still be validated, although promising evidence has been collected. At present, the best candidate to the role of independent chemical messenger appears to be T1AM, and its most interesting effects concern metabolism and brain function. The responses elicited in experimental animals have suggested potential therapeutic applications. TA3 has an established role in thyroid hormone resistance syndromes, and is under investigation in Allen-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. Other potential targets are represented by obesity and dyslipidemia (for T2 and T1AM); dementia and degenerative brain disease (for T1AM and TA1); cancer (for T1AM and TA4).

We report here a novel neuromodulatory role for thyronamines. In synaptosomal preparations and heterologous expression systems, thyronamines act as specific dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

TAMs exert actions partly opposite to and distinct from known functions of thyroid hormones. These fascinating metabolic, anapyrexic, cytoprotective, and brain effects quickly evoked the hope to use hormone-derived TAMs as a therapeutic option. The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) TAAR1, a member of the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family, was identified as the first target and effector of TAM action. The initial enthusiasm on pharmacological actions of exogenous TAMs elicited many questions, such as sites of biosynthesis, analytics, modes of action, inactivation, and role of TAMs in (patho)physiology. Meanwhile, it became clear that TAMs not only interact with TAAR1 or other TAAR family members but also with several aminergic receptors and non-GPCR targets such as transient receptor potential channels, mitochondrial proteins, and the serum TAM-binding protein apolipoprotein B100, thus classifying 3T1AM as a multitarget ligand. The physiological mode of action of TAMs is still controversial because regulation of endogenous TAM production and the sites of its biosynthesis are not fully elucidated. Methods for 3T1AM analytics need further validation, as they revealed different blood and tissue concentrations depending on detection principles used such as monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay vs liquid chromatography- matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry or time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In this review, we comprehensively summarize and critically evaluate current basic, translational, and clinical knowledge on 3T1AM and its main metabolite 3-iodothyroacetic acid, focusing on endocrine-relevant aspects and open but highly challenging issues.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8627691,Anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of the thyroid hormone metabolite 3-iodothyroacetic acid,"Background: 3-Iodothyroacetic acid (TA1) is among the thyroid hormone (T3) metabolites that can acutely modify behavior in mice. This study aimed to investigate whether TA1 is also able to reduce neuron hyperexcitability and protect from excitotoxic damage. Methods: CD1 male mice were treated intraperitoneally with saline solution or TA1 (4, 7, 11, or 33 mu g/kg) before receiving 90 mg/kg pentylenetrazole subcutaneously. The following parameters were measured: latency to first seizure onset, number of mice experiencing seizures, hippocampal levels of c-fos, and PI3K/AKT activation levels. Organotypic hippocampal slices were exposed to vehicle or to 5 mu M kainic acid (KA) in the absence or presence of 0.01-10 mu M TA1. In another set of experiments, slices were exposed to vehicle or 5 mu M KA in the absence or presence of 10 mu M T3, 3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC), T1AM, thyronamine (T0AM), or thyroacetic acid (TA0). Neuronal cell death was measured fluorimetically. The ability of TA1 and T3, TRIAC, T1AM, T0A, and TA0 to activate the PI3K/AKT cascade was evaluated by Western blot. The effect of TA1 on KA-induced currents in CA3 neurons was evaluated by patch clamp recordings on acute hippocampal slices. Results: TA1 (7 and 11 mu g/kg) significantly reduced the number of mice showing convulsions and increased their latency of onset, restored pentylenetrazole-induced reduction of hippocampal c-fos levels, activated the PI3K/AKT, and reduced GSK-3 beta activity. In rat organotypic hippocampal slices, TA1 reduced KA-induced cell death by activating the PI3K/AKT cascade and increasing GSK-3 beta phosphorylation levels. Protection against KA toxicity was also exerted by T3 and other T3 metabolites studied. TA1 did not interact at KA receptors. Both the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of TA1 were abolished by pretreating mice or organotypic hippocampal slices with pyrilamine, an histamine type 1 receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg or 1 mu M, respectively). Conclusions: TA1 exerts anticonvulsant activity and is neuroprotective in vivo and in vitro. These findings extend the current knowledge on the pharmacological profile of TA1 and indicate possible novel clinical use for this T3 metabolite.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8627692,"In the brain of mice, 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) is converted into 3-iodothyroacetic acid (TA1) and it is included within the signaling network connecting thyroid hormone metabolites with histamine","3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) and its oxidative product, 3-iodotyhyroacetic acid (TTA1A), are known to stimulate learning and induce hyperalgesia in mice. We investigated whether i)TA1 may be generated in vivo from T1AM, ii) T1AM shares with TA1 the ability to activate the histaminergic system. Tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure TA1 and T1AM levels in i) the brain of mice following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of T1AM (11 mu g kg(-1)), with or without pretreatment with clorgyline, (2.5 mg kg(-1) i.p.), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor; ii) the medium of organotypic hippocampal slices exposed to T1AM (50 nM). In addition, learning and pain threshold were evaluated by the light-dark box task and the hot plate test, respectively, in mice pre-treated subcutaneously with pyrilamine (10 mg kg(-1)) or zolantidine (5 mg kg(-1)), 20 min before i.c.v. injection of T1AM (1.32 and 11 mu g kg(-1)). T1AM-induced hyperalgesia (1.32 and 11 mu g kg(-1)) was also evaluated in histidine decarboxylase (HDC-/-) mice. T1AM and TA1 brain levels increased in parallel in mice injected with T1AM with the TA1/T1AM averaging 1.7%. Clorgyline pre-treatment reduced the increase in both T1AM and TA1. TA1 was the main T1AM metabolite detected in the hippocampal preparations. Pretreatment with pyrilamine or zolantidine prevented the pro-learning effect of 1.32 and 4 mu g kg(-1) T1AM while hyperalgesia was conserved at the dose of 11 mu g kg(-1) T1AM. T1AM failed to induce hyperalgesia in HDC-/- mice at all the doses.

Apo E, Apo J, Apo A-I, Apo B, laminin, complement components C3 and C4, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin all displayed sub-micromolar apparent affinities for the Apo E binding site on fibrils. Transthyretin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, amyloid P protein, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, complement component C1q, chondroitin sulfate A, and GM1 ganglioside were much less effective. The epsilon 2, epsilon 3, and epsilon 4 isoforms of Apo E showed different affinities for fibrils and lipidation of these lipoproteins made little difference. Other fibrillar beta-peptides also bound Apo E, with A beta 40-A beta 42 > A beta(12-28); A beta(25-35) = 0. A series of soluble beta-peptides and fragments failed to effect Apo E binding. Thus, both conformational and quaternary structural features are important in high affinity binding of Apo E to A beta 40 fibrils.

8614908,The acute phase response of plasma proteins in the polyprotodont marsupial Monodelphis domestica,"In eutherians, patterns of plasma protein levels in blood change during the acute phase response to trauma and inflammation. Until now, such an acute phase response has not been characterised in a noneutherian species. Here we describe the acute phase response in a marsupial species, the South American polyprotodont marsupial Monodelphis domestica, after brain surgery or injection of lipopolysaccharide. Several days after brain surgery, transthyretin was not detected in plasma. For 48 hr following injection of lipopolysaccharide, the concentration of haptoglobin in plasma increased, that of transthyretin decreased, and the concentration of albumin in plasma did not change significantly. The American polyprotodont marsupials are probably more closely related to the common ancestor marsupial than the Australian marsupials are. It is most likely that the transthyretin gene was not expressed in the liver of this common ancestor. As the transthyretin gene is expressed in the liver of M. domestica, it seems that as soon as transthyretin is synthesised by the liver, it is under negative acute phase control.

8627693,Identification and Characterization of 3-Iodothyronamine Intracellular Transport,"3-Iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) is a naturally occurring thyroid hormone metabolite with distinct biological effects that are opposite those of thyroid hormone. The known molecular targets of T(1)AM include both plasma membrane and intracellular proteins, suggesting that intracellular transport of T(1)AM may be an important component of its action, although no uptake mechanism has yet been described. Using various human cell lines, we show that, indeed, cellular uptake of T(1)AM occurs in multiple cell types and that this process involves specific, saturable, and inhibitable transport mechanisms. These mechanisms are sodium and chloride independent, pH dependent, thyronamine specific, and do not involve the likely candidate transporters of other monoamines, organic cations, or thyroid hormones. A large-scale RNA interference screen targeting the entire solute carrier superfamily of transporter genes reveals that the transport of T(1)AM into cells involves multiple transporters, and we identify eight transporters that may contribute to the uptake of T(1)AM in HeLa cells. This type of transporter small interfering RNA screening approach can be used in general to identify the constellation of transporters that participate in the intracellular disposition of compounds.

Administration of T1AM to rodents results in rapid and profound reduction in body temperature, heart rate, and metabolism. The structural similarities between thyroxine, T(1)AM, and monoamine neurotransmitters suggest an intriguing role for T(1)AM as both a neuromodulator and a hormone-like molecule that may constitute a part of thyroid hormone action. Several recent studies into its molecular mechanisms of action have shown that T(1)AM can target extracellular receptors such as the trace amine-associated receptors and the alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor, modulate the membrane transport of neurotransmitters, and serve as a substrate of specific membrane transport cellular uptake machinery.

Animal models do not reflect the biology of the human disease. Using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we generated MCT8-deficient neural cells that showed normal TH-dependent neuronal properties and maturation. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls TH entry into the brain, and reduced TH availability to neural cells could instead underlie the diseased phenotype. To test potential BBB involvement, we generated an iPSC-based BBB model of MCT8 deficiency, and we found that MCT8 was necessary for polarized influx of the active form of TH across the BBB. We also found that a candidate drug did not appreciably cross the mutant BBB. Our results therefore clarify the underlying physiological basis of this disorder, and they suggest that circumventing the diseased BBB to deliver active TH to the brain could be a viable therapeutic strategy.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Such tests must distinguish AD from other dementia causes, as well as differentiate subtle changes associated with normal aging from true pathology emergence. A single biomarker offering such diagnostic and prognostic capacities has eluded identification. Therefore, a valuable test for AD is likely to be based on a specific pattern of change in a set of proteins, rather than a single protein.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>We examined pooled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from neuropathologically-confirmed AD (n=43) and non-demented control subjects (n=43) using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) proteomic methodology to detect differentially expressed proteins. Proteins exhibiting expression level differences between the pools were recovered and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Five differentially-expressed proteins with potential roles in amyloid-beta metabolism and vascular and brain physiology [apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1), cathepsin D (CatD), hemopexin (HPX), transthyretin (TTR), and two pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) isoforms] were identified. Apo A-1, CatD and TTR were significantly reduced in the AD pool sample, while HPX and the PEDF isoforms were increased in AD CSF.<br /><br /><strong>DISCUSSION: </strong>These results suggest that multi-factor proteomic pattern analysis of the CSF may provide a means to diagnose and assess AD.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

To determine whether brain thyroid hormone levels contribute to these effects, we investigated the effect of central administration of T1AM on learning and pain threshold of mice either untreated or pretreated with clorgyline (2.5 mg.kg(-1), i.p.), an inhibitor of amine oxidative metabolism. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH T1AM (0.13, 0.4, 1.32 and 4 mu g.kg(-1)) or vehicle was injected i.c.v. into male mice, and after 30 min their effects on memory acquisition capacity, pain threshold and curiosity were evaluated by the following tests: passive avoidance, licking latency on the hot plate and movements on the hole-board platform. Plasma glycaemia was measured using a glucorefractometer. Brain levels of triiodothyroxine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and T1AM were measured by HPLC coupled to tandem MS. ERK1/2 activation and c-fos expression in different brain regions were evaluated by Western blot analysis. RESULTS T1AM improved learning capacity, decreased pain threshold to hot stimuli, enhanced curiosity and raised plasma glycaemia in a dose-dependent way, without modifying T3 and T4 brain concentrations. T1AM effects on learning and pain were abolished or significantly affected by clorgyline, suggesting a role for some metabolite(s), or that T1AM interacts at the rapid desensitizing target(s). T1AM activated ERK in different brain areas at lower doses than those effective on behaviour. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS T1AM is a novel memory enhancer.

8608666,Transthyretin: no association between serum levels or gene variants and schizophrenia,"It has been proposed that schizophrenia results from an environmental insult in genetically predisposed individuals. Environmental factors capable of modulating transcriptional activity and their carriers could link the genetic and environmental components of schizophrenia. Among these is transthyretin (TTR), a major carrier of thyroid hormones and retinol-binding protein (RBP). Retinoids and thyroid hormones regulate the expression of several genes, both during development and in the adult brain. Decreased TTR levels have been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with depression and Alzheimer's disease, and the absence of TTR influences behavior in mice. DNA variants capable of altering TTR ability to carry its ligands, either due to reduced transcription of the gene or to structural modifications of the protein, may influence development of the central nervous system and behavior. In the present study we searched for variants in the regulatory and coding regions of the TTR gene, and measured circulating levels of TTR and RBP. We found a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), ss46566417, 18 bp upstream of exon 4. Neither this SNP nor the previously described rs1800458 were found associated with schizophrenia. In addition, serum TTR and RBP levels did not differ between mentally healthy and schizophrenic individuals.

An in situ rat brain perfusion technique allowed perfusion of the radiotracer [(14)C]-L-Leu (a ligand for both LAT1 and LAT2) alone or competed with excess concentration of either LAT1 or LAT2 specific amino acids. The LAT2 specific amino acid, [(14)C]-L-Asn, was perfused alone or with excess concentration of various amino acids. The brain uptake of [(14)C]-L-Leu was not significantly inhibited by LAT2 specific amino acids, but was inhibited significantly (up to 90%) by the LAT1 specific amino acid, D-Met. L-Asn did not demonstrate saturable brain uptake. These data clearly demonstrate that LAT1 is the functionally predominant isoform expressed at the BBB which is responsible for brain uptake of large, neutral amino acids.

In transfected COS cells, oatp3 mediated Na(+)-independent, DIDS-inhibited taurocholate uptake (Michaelis-Menten constant approximately 30 microM). The oatp3-mediated uptake rates and affinities were highest for glycine-conjugated dihydroxy bile acids. In stably transfected, polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, oatp3 mediated only apical uptake of taurocholate. RT-PCR analysis revealed that rat oatp3, but not oatp1 or oatp2, was expressed in small intestine. By RNase protection assay, oatp3 mRNA was readily detected down the length of the small intestine as well as in brain, lung, and retina. An antibody directed to the carboxy terminus localized oatp3 to the apical brush-border membrane of rat jejunal enterocytes. The mouse oatp3 gene was localized to a region of mouse chromosome 6. This region is syntenic with human chromosome 12p12, where the human OATP-A gene was mapped, suggesting that rodent oatp3 is orthologous to the human OATP-A.

8627697,Biosynthesis of 3-iodothyronamine from T-4 in murine intestinal tissue,"The endogenous metabolite 3-iodothyronamine (3-T(1)AM) induces strong hypothermia and bradycardia at pharmacological doses. Although its biosynthesis from thyroid hormone precursors appears likely, the sequence and sites of reactions are still controversial: studies in T-4-substituted thyroid cancer patients lacking functional thyroid tissue suggested extrathyroidal 3-T(1)AM production, whereas studies using labeled T-4 in mice indicated intrathyroidal formation. However, because the patients received T-4 orally, whereas the mice were injected ip, we hypothesized that 3-T(1)AM synthesis requires the intestinal passage of T-4. Using the everted gut sac model in combination with mass spectrometry, we demonstrate 3-T(1)AM production from T-4 in mouse intestine via several deiodination and decarboxylation steps. Gene expression analysis confirmed the expression of all 3 deiodinases as well as ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in intestine. Subsequent experiments employing purified human ODC revealed that this enzyme can in fact mediate decarboxylation of 3,5-T-2 and T-4 to the respective thyronamines (TAMs), demonstrating that the intestine expresses the entire molecular machinery required for 3-T(1)AM biosynthesis. Interestingly, TAM production was strongly affected by the antithyroid treatment methimazole and perchlorate independently of thyroid status, limiting the validity of the respective mouse models in this context. Taken together, our data demonstrate intestinal 3-T(1)AM biosynthesis from T-4 involving decarboxylation through ODC with subsequent deiodination, and explain the apparent discrepancy between 3-T(1)AM serum levels in patients substituted orally and mice injected ip with T-4.

To provide a reference for the relative expression levels, the expression of various transporter mRNAs in choroid plexus were compared with that in liver, kidney, and ileum. The mRNA levels of multidrug resistance protein (Mrp)1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; multidrug resistance (Mdr)1a, 1b, and 2; organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp)1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, and Oat-K (1/2); organic anion transporter (Oat)1, 2, and 3; organic cation transporter (Oct)1, 2, 3, N1, and N2; bile acid transporters sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp), bile salt excretory protein (Bsep), and ileal bile acid transporter (Ibat); divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), Menke's and Wilson's metal transporters; equilibrative nucleotide transporters (Ent) 1 and 2, and constitutive nucleotide transporters (Cnt)1 and 2; peptide transporters (Pept)1 and 2; as well as ATP-binding cassette (Abc)G5 and 8 were measured in choroid plexus by the branched DNA signal amplification method. Mrp1, 4, and 5, Oatp3, Menke's transporter, DMT1, Ent1, and Pept2 mRNAs were expressed in choroid plexus at higher levels than in liver, kidney, or ileum.

By means of the RT-PCR method, transcripts of LAT1, LAT2 and heavy chain of 4F2 antigen (4F2hc) were detected in rat primary cultured brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) and immortalized subline, RBEC1. The uptake properties of RBEC1, such as [3H]leucine and L-[3H]DOPA uptake, were similar to those of primary cultured BCECs. So, RBEC1 may retain almost native properties of the large neutral amino acid uptake activities. [3H]Leucine uptake by RBEC1 showed two saturable components and the Km values of the high- and low-affinity components were 8.92+/-3.18 and 119+/-45 microM, respectively. The Km value of the high-affinity component agreed well with that of LAT1 and the amino acid transport selectivity of RBEC1 was similar to that of LAT1. Therefore, it is suggested that LAT1 is important at the blood-brain barrier of rats. Additionally, the Km value of the low-affinity component was similar to that of LAT2. These observations indicate that LAT1 and LAT2 are involved as transporters for large neutral amino acids at the blood-brain barrier.

The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain.

The APOLLO study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. The effects of patisiran on cardiac structure and function in a prespecified subpopulation of patients with evidence of cardiac amyloid involvement at baseline were assessed.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>APOLLO was an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran or placebo via intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks for 18 months. The prespecified cardiac subpopulation comprised patients with a baseline left ventricular wall thickness ≥13 mm and no history of hypertension or aortic valve disease. Prespecified exploratory cardiac end points included mean left ventricular wall thickness, global longitudinal strain, and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide. Cardiac parameters in the overall APOLLO patient population were also evaluated. A composite end point of cardiac hospitalizations and all-cause mortality was assessed in a post hoc analysis.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>In the cardiac subpopulation (n=126; 56% of total population), patisiran reduced mean left ventricular wall thickness (least-squares mean difference ± SEM: -0.9±0.4 mm, P=0.017), interventricular septal wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, and relative wall thickness at month 18 compared with placebo. Patisiran also led to increased end-diastolic volume (8.3±3.9 mL, P=0.036), decreased global longitudinal strain (-1.4±0.6%, P=0.015), and increased cardiac output (0.38±0.19 L/min, P=0.044) compared with placebo at month 18. Patisiran lowered N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide at 9 and 18 months (at 18 months, ratio of fold-change patisiran/placebo 0.45, P<0.001). A consistent effect on N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide at 18 months was observed in the overall APOLLO patient population (n=225). Median follow-up duration was 18.7 months. The exposure-adjusted rates of cardiac hospitalizations and all-cause death were 18.7 and 10.1 per 100 patient-years in the placebo and patisiran groups, respectively (Andersen-Gill hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.28-1.01).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Patisiran decreased mean left ventricular wall thickness, global longitudinal strain, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, and adverse cardiac outcomes compared with placebo at month 18, suggesting that patisiran may halt or reverse the progression of the cardiac manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis.<br /><br /><strong>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: </strong>URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

In this model, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was completed in 14 days, with a loss of about 50% dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and a loss of more than 80% dopamine terminals in the striatum, with a similar diminution of dopamine levels in both structures. Proteins were separated by 2D electrophoresis and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). We found significant increases of haptoglobin and transthyretin along with a decrease of Apo E concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of axotomized animals. Changes for haptoglobin and transthyretin were further confirmed in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma by Western blotting. These results suggest that monitoring plasma levels of these signals appears to be a promising biological marker of neuronal degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
4298542,6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans is promoted by the engulfment pathway and inhibited by the transthyretin-related protein TTR-33,"Oxidative stress is linked to many pathological conditions including the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. The vast majority of disease cases appear to be caused by a combination of genetic mutations and environmental factors. We screened for genes protecting Caenorhabditis elegans dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stress induced by the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and identified the transthyretin-related gene ttr-33. The only described C. elegans transthyretin-related protein to date, TTR-52, has been shown to mediate corpse engulfment as well as axon repair. We demonstrate that TTR-52 and TTR-33 have distinct roles. TTR-33 is likely produced in the posterior arcade cells in the head of C. elegans larvae and is predicted to be a secreted protein. TTR-33 protects C. elegans from oxidative stress induced by paraquat or H2O2 at an organismal level. The increased oxidative stress sensitivity of ttr-33 mutants is alleviated by mutations affecting the KGB-1 MAPK kinase pathway, whereas it is enhanced by mutation of the JNK-1 MAPK kinase. Finally, we provide genetic evidence that the C. elegans cell corpse engulfment pathway is required for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons after exposure to 6-OHDA. In summary, we describe a new neuroprotective mechanism and demonstrate that TTR-33 normally functions to protect dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stress-induced degeneration, potentially by acting as a secreted sensor or scavenger of oxidative stress.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Unclear_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
7973073,The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in critical illness,"The thyroid axis is comprised of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) at the level of the hypothalamus which stimulates the pituitary to release thyrotropin (TSH). TSH in turn stimulates the thyroid to secrete the pro-hormone thyroxin (T4) and to a lesser extent the receptor active hormone tri-iodothyronine (T3). The majority of circulating T3 is generated by peripheral conversion of T4 by the intracellular iodothyronine deiodinases. Thyroid hormone (TH) is transported over the cell membrane by specific TH transporters such as monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8). After transport and metabolisation in the cell, T3 can interact with nuclear TH receptors and activate or inactivate TH responsive genes. Critically ill patients show uniform disturbances in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. There is clear evidence that circulating and tissue TH levels are low and this is called the low T3 syndrome or non-thyroidal illness syndrome. The clinical importance of the low T3 syndrome is still not very clear because it can either protect against or aggravate the catabolic state. Recently, novel insights were generated into the pathophysiology of the low T3 syndrome. Recent studies in animal models as well as in patients have shown alterations in TH transport and also in deiodinase activity which, together, may suggest an attempt of certain peripheral tissues as well as of the hypothalamus to compensate for low circulating TH levels. Reduced expression of TRH in the hypothalamus appears to play a key role in the prolonged phase of critical illness, although the processes that trigger this upstream disturbance remain unclear.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973075,Action of specific thyroid hormone receptor α(1) and β(1) antagonists in the central and peripheral regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism in the rat,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>The iodine-containing drug amiodarone (Amio) and its noniodine containing analogue dronedarone (Dron) are potent antiarrhythmic drugs. Previous in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the major metabolite of Amio, desethylamiodarone, acts as a thyroid hormone receptor (TR) α(1) and β(1) antagonist, whereas the major metabolite of Dron debutyldronedarone acts as a selective TRα(1) antagonist. In the present study, Amio and Dron were used as tools to discriminate between TRα(1) or TRβ(1) regulated genes in central and peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Three groups of male rats received either Amio, Dron, or vehicle by daily intragastric administration for 2 weeks. We assessed the effects of treatment on triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)) plasma and tissue concentrations, deiodinase type 1, 2, and 3 mRNA expressions and activities, and thyroid hormone transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), monocarboxylate transporter 10 (MCT10), and organic anion transporter 1C1 (OATP1C1).<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Amio treatment decreased serum T(3), while serum T(4) and thyrotropin (TSH) increased compared to Dron-treated and control rats. At the central level of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis, Amio treatment decreased hypothalamic thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) expression, while increasing pituitary TSHβ and MCT10 mRNA expression. Amio decreased the pituitary D2 activity. By contrast, Dron treatment resulted in decreased hypothalamic TRH mRNA expression only. Upon Amio treatment, liver T(3) concentration decreased substantially compared to Dron and control rats (50%, p<0.01), but liver T(4) concentration was unaffected. In addition, liver D1, mRNA, and activity decreased, while the D3 activity and mRNA increased. Liver MCT8, MCT10, and OATP1C1 mRNA expression were similar between groups.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Our results suggest an important role for TRα1 in the regulation of hypothalamic TRH mRNA expression, whereas TRβ plays a dominant role in pituitary and liver thyroid hormone metabolism.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973076,Parallel regulation of thyroid hormone transporters OATP1c1 and MCT8 during and after endotoxemia at the blood-brain barrier of male rodents,"There is increasing evidence that local thyroid hormone (TH) availability changes profoundly in inflammatory conditions due to altered expression of deiodinases that metabolize TH. It is largely unknown, however, how inflammation affects TH availability via the expression of TH transporters. In this study we examined the effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration on two TH transporters that are critically important for brain TH homeostasis, organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1c1 (OATP1c1), and monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8). MRNA levels were studied by in situ hybridization and qPCR as well as protein levels by immunofluorescence in both the rat and mouse forebrain. The mRNA of both transporters decreased robustly in the first 9 hours after LPS injection, specifically in brain blood vessels; OATP1c1 mRNA in astrocytes and MCT8 mRNA in neurons remained unchanged. At 24 and/or 48 hours after LPS administration, OATP1c1 and MCT8 mRNAs increased markedly above control levels in brain vessels. OATP1c1 protein decreased markedly in vessels by 24 hours whereas MCT8 protein levels did not decrease significantly. These changes were highly similar in mice and rats. The data demonstrate that OATP1c1 and MCT8 expression are regulated in a parallel manner during inflammation at the blood-brain barrier of rodents. Given the indispensable role of both transporters in allowing TH access to the brain, the results suggest reduced brain TH uptake during systemic inflammation.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973077,"Evaluation and mechanistic study of chlordecone-induced thyroid disruption: Based on in vivo, in vitro and in silico assays","The present study aimed to evaluate the thyroid-disrupting potency of chlordecone, and reveal the underlying mechanism. In the in vivo assays, rare minnow embryos were exposed to 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 μg·L-1 chlordecone until sexually mature. The results showed decreased T4 but increased T3 concentrations in plasma, upregulated mRNA levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (trhr) and sodium-iodide symporter (nis) in the brain, and transthyretin (ttr), thyroid hormone receptor α (trα) and deiodinase enzymes (dio1 and dio2) in the liver of adult fish. In the in vitro assays, single chlordecone treatments promoted growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion in GH3 cells. Transcription of thyroid receptor (trβ) was inhibited, but this is not likely responsible for chlordecone-induced GH secretion and altered transcription. When co-treated with T3, chlordecone acted independently of the effect of T3 on GH secretion; chlordecone-induced GH/PRL secretion and mRNA expression were further promoted when co-treated with E2, but inhibited when co-treated with ICI, indicating an important role for estrogen receptors (ERs) in chlordecone-induced changes in GH3 cells. Furthermore, in silico prediction suggested no stable interactions between chlordecone and thyroid hormone-related proteins, as well as a regulatory role for ERs in thyroid systems. Overall, our results indicated that chlordecone may have adverse effects on thyroid systems upon long-term exposure. However, rather of TRs, ERs may be responsible for thyroid disruption following chlordecone exposure.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973083,Zebrafish - An emerging model to explore thyroid hormone transporters and psychomotor retardation,"Thyroid hormones (THs) regulate a variety of fundamental physiological processes, including the development and maintenance of the brain. For decades, it was thought that THs enter the cells by passive diffusion. However, it is now clear that TH transport across the cell membrane requires specific transporter proteins that facilitate the uptake and efflux of THs. Several thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters (THTTs) have been identified, including monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), MCT10, and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1). The critical role of THTTs in regulating metabolism and brain function is demonstrated in the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X-linked psychomotor retardation associated with mutations in the MCT8/SLC16A2 gene. In addition to traditional research on humans, cell-lines, and rodents, the zebrafish has recently emerged as an attractive model to study THTTs and neuroendocrinological-related disorders. In this review, we describe the unique contribution of zebrafish studies to the understanding of the functional role of THTTs in live animals, and how this transparent vertebrate model can be used for translational studies on TH-related disorders.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973086,"Thyroid hormone regulation of rhes, a novel Ras homolog gene expressed in the striatum","Thyroid hormone action on brain development is essentially exerted through regulation of the expression rate of a number of genes some of which have been identified in the past 10 years. In the present work we describe the thyroid hormone regulation of a novel Ras homolog which we have named Rhes (Ras homolog enriched in striatum). The rhes cDNA was previously isolated in subtractive hybridization experiments aimed at identifying cDNA clones corresponding to genes expressed preferentially in the rat striatum. The sequence was found to encode a small GTP-binding protein of the Ras family with highest homology to the dexamethasone-inducible Dexras1. Here we show that rhes mRNA and protein in the striatum are strongly dependent on the thyroidal status. Developmentally, Rhes was regulated such that in normal rats there was an increased rhes mRNA content in the striatum after postnatal day 5 (P5). Rhes concentration in hypothyroid rats was similar to that of normal rats at P5, but the subsequent age-dependent increase was blunted. The administration of a single T3 dose to hypothyroid rats normalized rhes mRNA concentration in 8 h, whereas it took 24 h, or more, to normalize the expression of rc3, another T3-dependent brain gene, involved in PKC signaling. Double in situ hybridization using rhes and rc3 riboprobes showed that the bulk of rhes signal was located in cells expressing rc3. Given the relevance of small GTPases in signal transduction it is very likely that control of rhes, in addition to rc3, is of relevance to explain the actions of thyroid hormone in the striatum, a region of the brain especially vulnerable in neurological cretinism.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Based on its affinity for transthyretin, TBP could compete with endogenous thyroid hormone. In this study, the effects of TBP on the thyroid hormone system were assessed in mice. Briefly, animals were exposed to 40 and 250 mg/kg TBP. Thyroid hormones were also administered with or without TBP. When mice were treated with TBP, deiodinase 1 (Dio1) and thyroid hormone receptor β isoform 2 (Thrβ2) decreased in the pituitary gland. The levels of deiodinase 2 (Dio2) and growth hormone (Gh) mRNA increased in response to 250 mg/kg of TBP, and the relative mRNA level of thyroid stimulating hormone β (Tshβ) increased in the pituitary gland. Dio1 and Thrβ1 expression in the liver were not altered, while Dio1 decreased in response to co-treatment with thyroid hormones. The thyroid gland activity decreased in response to TBP, as did the levels of free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine in serum. Taken together, these findings indicate that TBP can disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis and the presence of TBP influenced thyroid actions as regulators of gene expression.

7973103,Leptin prevents fasting-induced suppression of prothyrotropin-releasing hormone messenger ribonucleic acid in neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus,"Prolonged fasting is associated with a number of changes in the thyroid axis manifested by low serum T3 and T4 levels and, paradoxically, low or normal TSH. This response is, at least partly, caused by suppression of proTRH gene expression in neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and reduced hypothalamic TRH release. Because the fall in thyroid hormone levels can be blunted in mice by the systemic administration of leptin, we raised the possibility that leptin may have an important role in the neuroendocrine regulation of the thyroid axis, through effects on hypophysiotropic neurons producing proTRH. Adult male, Sprague-Dawley rats were either fed normally, fasted for 3 days, or fasted and administered leptin at a dose of 0.5 microg/gm BW i.p. every 6 h. Fasted animals showed significant reduction in plasma total and free T4 and T3 levels compared with controls, that were restored toward normal by the administration of leptin. Percent free T4, but not percent free T3, increased during fasting, further suggesting a reduction in plasma transthyretin levels that did not return to fed levels after leptin administration. By semiquantitative analysis of in situ hybridization autoradiograms, proTRH messenger RNA in medial parvocellular PVN neurons was markedly suppressed in the fasting animals but was restored to normal by leptin administration [fed vs. fast vs. fast/leptin (density units x 10(8)): 8.5 +/- 0.4, 3.2 +/- 0.2, 8.1 +/- 0.8]. In contrast, proTRH messenger RNA in adjacent neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that do not have a hypophysiotropic function remained unchanged by any of the experimental manipulations. These findings indicate that leptin has a selective, central action to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis by regulating proTRH gene expression in the PVN but does not have peripheral effects on thyroid-binding proteins. We propose that the fall in circulating leptin levels during fasting resets the set point for feedback inhibition by thyroid hormones on the biosynthesis of hypophysiotropic proTRH, thereby allowing adaptation to starvation.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

By contrast, both D3 and MCT8 are expressed by neurons of the paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic, and infundibular nucleus (IFN). In support of these immunocytochemical data, D2 and D3 enzyme activities are detectable in the mediobasal human hypothalamus. Combined D2, D3, MCT8, and thyroid hormone receptor immunohistochemistry and TRH mRNA in situ hybridization clearly showed that D3, MCT8, and thyroid hormone receptor isoforms are all expressed in TRH neurons of the PVN, whereas D2 is not.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: </strong>Based on these findings, we propose three possible routes for thyroid hormone feedback on TRH neurons in the human PVN: 1) local thyroid hormone uptake from the vascular compartment within the PVN, 2) thyroid hormone uptake from the cerebrospinal fluid in the third ventricle followed by transport to TRH neurons in the PVN or IFN neurons projecting to TRH neurons in the PVN, and 3) thyroid hormone sensing in the IFN of the mediobasal hypothalamus by neurons projecting to TRH neurons in the PVN.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973106,Transport of thyroid hormones via the choroid plexus into the brain: the roles of transthyretin and thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters,"Thyroid hormones are key players in regulating brain development. Thus, transfer of appropriate quantities of thyroid hormones from the blood into the brain at specific stages of development is critical. The choroid plexus forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In reptiles, birds and mammals, the main protein synthesized and secreted by the choroid plexus is a thyroid hormone distributor protein: transthyretin. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. Maximal transthyretin synthesis in the choroid plexus occurs just prior to the period of rapid brain growth, suggesting that choroid plexus-derived transthyretin moves thyroid hormones from blood into cerebrospinal fluid just prior to when thyroid hormones are required for rapid brain growth. The structure of transthyretin has been highly conserved, implying strong selection pressure and an important function. In mammals, transthyretin binds T4 (precursor form of thyroid hormone) with higher affinity than T3 (active form of thyroid hormone). In all other vertebrates, transthyretin binds T3 with higher affinity than T4. As mammals are the exception, we should not base our thinking about the role of transthyretin in the choroid plexus solely on mammalian data. Thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters are involved in moving thyroid hormones into and out of cells and have been identified in many tissues, including the choroid plexus. Thyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid. The quantitative contribution of each route during development remains to be elucidated.

7973109,Effects of experimentally induced hyperthyroidism on central hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in rats: in vitro and in situ studies,"Hyperthyroidism is associated with hypercorticosteronemia, although the locus that is principally responsible for the hypercorticosteronism remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of hyperthyroidism on the functional integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, to identify the locus in the HPA axis that is principally affected, and address the time-dependent effects of alterations in thyroid status. The functional integrity of each component of the HPA axis was examined in vitro and in situ in sham-thyroidectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats given placebo or in thyroidectomized rats given pharmacological dose (50 μg) of thyroxin for 7 or 60 days. Basal plasma corticosterone and corticosterone binding globulin (CBG) concentrations were significantly increased in short- and long-term hyperthyroid rats, and by 60 days. Basal plasma ACTH levels were similar to controls. Both hypothalamic CRH content and the magnitude of KCL- and arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced CRH release from hypothalamic culture were increased in long-term hyperthyroid rats. There was a significant increase in the content of both ACTH and β-endorphin in the anterior pituitaries of both short- and long-term hyperthyroid animals. Short-term hyperthyroid rats showed a significant increase in basal POMC mRNA expression in the anterior pituitary, and chronically hyperthyroid animals showed increased stress-induced POMC mRNA expression. Adrenal cultures taken from short-term hyperthyroid rats responded to exogenous ACTH with an exaggerated corticosterone response, while those taken from 60-day hyperthyroid animals showed responses similar to controls. The findings show that hyperthyroidism is associated with hypercorticosteronemia and HPA axis dysfunction that becomes more pronounced as the duration of hyperthyroidism increases.

7973111,Prenatal Treatment of Thyroid Hormone Cell Membrane Transport Defect Caused by MCT8 Gene Mutation,"Background: Mutations of the thyroid hormone (TH)-specific cell membrane transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), produce an X-chromosome-linked syndrome of TH deficiency in the brain and excess in peripheral tissues. The clinical consequences include brain hypothyroidism causing severe psychoneuromotor abnormalities (no speech, truncal hypotonia, and spastic quadriplegia) and hypermetabolism (poor weight gain, tachycardia, and increased metabolism, associated with high serum levels of the active TH, T3). Treatment in infancy and childhood with TH analogues that reduce serum triiodothyronine (T3) corrects hypermetabolism, but has no effect on the psychoneuromotor deficits. Studies of brain from a 30-week-old MCT8-deficient embryo indicated that brain abnormalities were already present during fetal life. Methods: A carrier woman with an affected male child (MCT8 A252fs268*), pregnant with a second affected male embryo, elected to carry the pregnancy to term. We treated the fetus with weekly 500 μg intra-amniotic instillation of levothyroxine (LT4) from 18 weeks of gestation until birth at 35 weeks. Thyroxine (T4), T3, and thyrotropin (TSH) were measured in the amniotic fluid and maternal serum. Treatment after birth was continued with LT4 and propylthiouracil. Follow-up included brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurodevelopmental evaluation, both compared with the untreated brother. Results: During intrauterine life, T4 and T3 in the amniotic fluid were maintained above threefold to twofold the baseline and TSH was suppressed by 80%, while maternal serum levels remained unchanged. At birth, the infant serum T4 was 14.5 μg/dL and TSH <0.01 mU/L compared with the average in untreated MCT8-deficient infants of 5.1 μg/ and >8 mU/L, respectively. MRI at six months of age showed near-normal brain myelination compared with much reduced in the untreated brother. Neurodevelopmental assessment showed developmental quotients in receptive language and problem-solving, and gross motor and fine motor function ranged from 12 to 25 at 31 months in the treated boy and from 1 to 7 at 58 months in the untreated brother. Conclusions: This is the first demonstration that prenatal treatment improved the neuromotor and neurocognitive function in MCT8 deficiency. Earlier treatment with TH analogues that concentrate in the fetus when given to the mother may further rescue the phenotype.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973112,Hippocampal Gene Expression Is Highly Responsive to Estradiol Replacement in Middle-Aged Female Rats,"In the hippocampus, estrogens are powerful modulators of neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. In women, menopause is associated with increased risk of memory disturbances, which can be attenuated by timely estrogen therapy. In animal models of menopause, 17β-estradiol (E2) replacement improves hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. Here, we explored the effect of E2 replacement on hippocampal gene expression in a rat menopause model. Middle-aged ovariectomized female rats were treated continuously for 29 days with E2, and then, the hippocampal transcriptome was investigated with Affymetrix expression arrays. Microarray data were analyzed by Bioconductor packages and web-based softwares, and verified with quantitative PCR. At standard fold change selection criterion, 156 genes responded to E2. All alterations but 4 were transcriptional activation. Robust activation (fold change > 10) occurred in the case of transthyretin, klotho, claudin 2, prolactin receptor, ectodin, coagulation factor V, Igf2, Igfbp2, and sodium/sulfate symporter. Classification of the 156 genes revealed major groups, including signaling (35 genes), metabolism (31 genes), extracellular matrix (17 genes), and transcription (16 genes). We selected 33 genes for further studies, and all changes were confirmed by real-time PCR. The results suggest that E2 promotes retinoid, growth factor, homeoprotein, neurohormone, and neurotransmitter signaling, changes metabolism, extracellular matrix composition, and transcription, and induces protective mechanisms via genomic effects. We propose that these mechanisms contribute to effects of E2 on neurogenesis, neural plasticity, and memory functions. Our findings provide further support for the rationale to develop safe estrogen receptor ligands for the maintenance of cognitive performance in postmenopausal women.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
7973114,Metabolism of the thyroid hormones,"This review covers the current knowledge about the various metabolic pathways involved in the conversion of thyroid hormones to the thyromimetically active and inactive iodothyronines. The concerted mechanism of systemic and local production of iodothyronines by tissue-specific iodothyronine deiodinase isozymes will ultimately determine the expression of thyroid hormone action. This is exemplified for the regulation of synthesis and release of TSH by iodothyronines at the pituitary level. Iodothyronine metabolites, e.g. Triac, rT3 and T3 amine may modulate TSH secretion, and alterations of local pituitary deiodination (e.g. iopanoate inhibition) influence diurnal TSH secretion without changing TRH-dependent episodic TSH secretion pattern. A summary of structure-activity relationships of greater than 200 naturally occurring and synthetic ligands of rat liver type I iodothyronine deiodinase isozyme propylthiouracil-sensitive) in vitro allows the design of iodothyronine analogues which either serve as specific substrates or antagonists of iodothyronine binding and metabolizing proteins. Furthermore, a complete picture of the ligand-complementary active site of the type I isozyme can be derived. A synthetic 'structurally optimized' iodothyronine-analogue flavonoid inhibitor of the type I deiodinase is able to displace T4 from binding to thyroxine-binding prealbumin and leads to unexpected organ-specific alterations of thyroid hormone metabolism and expression of thyroid hormone actions in an animal model. Therefore, for a complete understanding of thyroid hormone metabolism and action, thyroid hormone transport, cellular compartmentalization, and alternate pathways also have to be considered.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
7973117,Developmental patterns of gene expression of secreted proteins in brain and choroid plexus,"The proteins secreted by the choroid plexus throughout rat brain development were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following biosynthetic labeling of choroid plexus pieces with [14C]leucine in vitro. Approximately 20 major protein species were resolved which, with the exception of transferrin, transthyretin, and alpha 2-macroglobulin, appear to be unrelated to proteins found in high concentrations in plasma. Several patterns of developmental regulation were observed. At least two of the proteins were synthesized and secreted at high levels only by fetal choroid plexus, whereas the secretion of several other proteins including transferrin and proteins comigrating with cystatin C and alpha 2-macroglobulin increased only after birth. The levels of mRNA coding for transferrin, ceruloplasmin, cystatin C, alpha 2-macroglobulin, beta 2-microglobulin, and transthyretin were measured in the brain during development by dot hybridization and northern gel analysis. No mRNA was detected coding for the proteins alpha-fetoprotein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, and thiostatin in the brain at any stage. For those proteins, which are produced in other parts of the brain as well as by the choroid plexus, the changes in their corresponding mRNA levels measured in whole brain paralleled the changes in their secretion by the choroid plexus. The results presented in this paper show that the choroid plexus is active in protein secretion at all stages studied. The changing pattern of protein secretion by the choroid plexus, combined with its early development compared with other tissues in the brain, suggests that it is active in providing the appropriate extracellular environment for the growth and differentiation of the brain.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7973118,Experimentally-induced hyperthyroidism is associated with activation of the rat hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,"<strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>Previous studies on the effects of altered thyroid function on the secretion and metabolism of adrenocortical hormones suggest a degree of adrenocortical hyperactivity in hyperthyroidism. We have previously shown that experimentally-induced hyperthyroidism is associated with significant alterations in pituitary-adrenal responsiveness to synthetic ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (oCRH) that are contingent upon the duration of the altered thyroid function. The purpose of this study was to assess the time-dependent effects of hyperthyroidism on the functional integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by in vivo stimulation of the hypothalamic CRH neuron and adrenal cortex.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The functional integrity of the HPA axis was examined in vivo in sham-thyroidectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats given placebo or in thyroidectomized rats given 50 mug of thyroxine every day for 7 or 60 days. Responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and IL-1alpha stimulation were used to assess the hypothalamic CRH neuron. Adrenocortical reserve was assessed in response to low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), following suppression of the HPA axis with dexamethasone. Adrenal and thymus tissue weight, in addition to basal plasma ACTH, corticosterone and thyroid indices were also determined.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Basal plasma corticosterone and corticosterone binding globulin (CBG) concentrations were significantly increased in short- and long-term hyperthyroid rats, and by 60 days, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) corticosterone levels were significantly increased. Basal plasma ACTH levels were similar to controls. Although plasma ACTH responses to hypoglycemic stress and IL-1alpha administration in both short- and long-term hyperthyroidism were normal, corticosterone responses to the ACTH release during the administration of these stimuli were significantly increased. The adrenal reserve was significantly elevated in short-term hyperthyroidsim. Long-term hyperthyroidism, however, was associated with a significant reduction in adrenocortical reserve. A significant increase in adrenal weights and a decrease in thymus weights were observed in both short- and long-term hyperthyroidism.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>The available data confirms that hyperthyroidism is associated with hypercorticosteronemia, although the locus that is principally affected still remains unclear. Despite the sustained hyperactivity of the HPA axis, long-term experimentally-induced hyperthyroidism is associated with diminished adrenal functional reserve. The alterations in HPA function in states of disturbed thyroid function were found to be somewhat more pronounced as the duration of thyroid dysfunction increased.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973119,Distinct positive and negative elements control the limited hepatocyte and choroid plexus expression of transthyretin in transgenic mice,"Transthyretin (TTR) is a thyroid hormone transport protein that is secreted by hepatocytes into the serum and by the choroid plexus epithelium into the cerebral spinal fluid. The protein is not made elsewhere in adult animals in significant amounts. We find that the start site for mRNA synthesis is the same in both cell types. The sequences required for mouse TTR expression in cultured hepatocytes include an enhancer at -1.86 to -1.96 kbp and a promoter-proximal region at -70 to -200 bp relative to the mRNA cap site. We demonstrate that in transgenic mice these regulatory regions (approximately 300 bp) are sufficient for quantitatively normal expression of a TTR minigene in hepatocytes, but not for restricted expression in the choroid plexus cells of the brain. Instead, they direct aberrant widespread expression in regions of the brain outside the choroid plexus. With 3 kbp of upstream sequence the TTR minigene is expressed specifically in the choroid plexus as well as in the liver, demonstrating the normal cell type specificity for TTR. These results suggest that 3 kbp of upstream sequence contains positive element(s) required for choroid plexus expression which are distinct from those utilized in the hepatocyte, and may also contain negative element(s) that function to suppress transcription in other brain cell types.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973120,Severe neurological abnormalities in a young boy with impaired thyroid hormone sensitivity due to a novel mutation in the MCT8 gene,"Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is an active and specific thyroid hormone transporter into neurons. MCT8 mutations cause an X-linked condition known as Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome and are characterized by impaired psychomotor development and typical abnormal thyroid function. We describe a 10-year-old boy with severe cognitive disability, axial hypotonia, spastic quadriplegia and sporadic dyskinetic episodes. He initially presented with thyroid dysfunction (high FT3, low rT3, low FT4 and normal TSH) and generalized retardation of the cerebral and cerebellar myelination in brain magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical and laboratory findings led to sequencing of the SLC16A2/MCT8 gene, which identified a novel missense mutation in exon 5. The study of peripheral markers of thyroid function suggests a paradoxical state of thyrotoxicosis in some peripheral tissues. Our patient had a typical clinical presentation at birth but because of the rarity of his disease his diagnosis was not made until the age of 7. The delay can also be explained by the omission of the free T3 assay in the first thyroid evaluation performed. This case therefore highlights the possible benefit of including the T3 assay in the study of patients with severe psychomotor disability of unknown etiology, thus eliminating extra costs for unnecessary complementary diagnostic tests.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7923780,"Monocrotophos pesticide decreases the plasma levels of total 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine and alters the expression of genes associated with the thyroidal axis in female goldfish (Carassius auratus)","Our recent study showed that monocrotophos (MCP) pesticide disrupted the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in male goldfish (Carassius auratus); however, the effects of MCP on the thyroid system in female goldfish are remain unclear. In the present study, plasma thyroid hormone (TH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were evaluated in female goldfish exposed to 0.01, 0.10, and 1.00 mg/L of 40% MCP-based pesticide for 21 days in a semi-static exposure system. Expression profiles of HPT axis-responsive genes, including transthyretin (ttr), deiodinases (d1, d2, and d3), tshβ, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh), and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (crh), were determined. The results indicated that MCP decreased the plasma levels of total 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (TT3) and the ratio of TT3 to total 3,3',5,5'-l-thyroxine (TT4), and induced alternative expression of TH-related genes. Exposure to 0.01 and 0.10 mg/L MCP pesticide resulted in the up-regulation of ttr mRNA. The reduction of plasma TT3 levels was partly attributed to an increase in the metabolism of T3 in the liver, as revealed by the highly elevated hepatic d1 and d3 mRNA levels in the MCP treatment groups, and the expression of hepatic d3 showed a negative correlation with the plasma TT3/TT4 levels in females. Moreover, the plasma TSH levels were lower in females exposed to 0.01 and 0.10 mg/L MCP pesticide, whereas the up-regulation of tshβ mRNA levels was compensated by the decreased plasma TT3 levels.

1279110,Effects of perfluoroalkyl compounds on mRNA expression levels of thyroid hormone-responsive genes in primary cultures of avian neuronal cells,"There is growing interest in assessing the neurotoxic and endocrine disrupting potential of perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs). Several studies have reported in vitro and in vivo effects related to neuronal development, neural cell differentiation, prenatal and postnatal development and behavior. PFC exposure altered hormone levels and the expression of hormone-responsive genes in mammalian and aquatic species. This study is the first to assess the effects of PFCs on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in primary cultures of neuronal cells in two avian species: the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) and herring gull (Larus argentatus). The following thyroid hormone (TH)-responsive genes were examined using real-time reverse transcription-PCR: type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (D2), D3, transthyretin (TTR), neurogranin (RC3), octamer motif-binding factor (Oct-1), and myelin basic protein. Several PFCs altered the mRNA expression levels of genes associated with the TH pathway in avian neuronal cells. Short-chained PFCs (less than eight carbons) altered the expression of TH-responsive genes (D2, D3, TTR, and RC3) in chicken embryonic neuronal cells to a greater extent than long-chained PFCs (more than or equal to eight carbons). Variable transcriptional changes were observed in herring gull embryonic neuronal cells exposed to short-chained PFCs; mRNA levels of Oct-1 and RC3 were upregulated. This is the first study to report that PFC exposure alters mRNA expression in primary cultures of avian neuronal cells and may provide insight into the possible mechanisms of action of PFCs in the avian brain.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

New insights into the local regulation of thyroid hormone availability challenge long accepted dogmas,"Recent evidence derived from transgenic mouse models and findings in humans with mutations affecting thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism have convincingly supported a model of TH signalling in which regulated local adjustment of active TH concentrations is far more important than circulating plasma hormone levels. Although this theory was put forward several years ago and has been supported by significant, but inherently indirect evidence, recent insights from targeted deletion of the genes encoding deiodinase (Dio) isozymes have revived this model and greatly increased our understanding of TH metabolism. However, gene targeting proved to be a double edged sword, since the overall model was supported, but several predictions are apparently not consistent with the new experimental evidence. Human genetics further provided additional exciting data on the physiological role of Dio isozymes that need to be incorporated into any model of TH biology. The recent identification of mutations in the T3 plasma membrane transporter MCT8 has sparked new interest in the role of TH in brain function, since affected patients suffered from psychomotor retardation. Moreover, selenium (Se) and TH physiology have finally been unequivocally connected by newly identified inherited defects in a gene involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis.

7642268,Function of thyroid hormone transporters in the central nervous system,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Iodothyronines are charged amino acid derivatives that cannot passively cross a phospholipid bilayer. Transport of thyroid hormones across plasma membranes is mediated by integral membrane proteins belonging to several gene families. These transporters therefore allow or limit access of thyroid hormones into brain. Since thyroid hormones are essential for brain development and cell differentiation, it is expected that genetic deficiency of such transporters would result in neurodevelopmental derangements.<br /><br /><strong>SCOPE OF REVIEW: </strong>We introduce concepts of thyroid hormone transport into the brain and into brain cells. Important thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters are presented along with their expression patterns in different brain cell types. A focus is placed on monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) which has been identified as an essential thyroid hormone transporter in humans. Mutations in MCT8 underlie one of the first described X-linked mental retardation syndromes, the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome.<br /><br /><strong>MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Thyroid hormone transporter molecules are expressed in a developmental and cell type-specific pattern. Any thyroid hormone molecule has to cross consecutively the luminal and abluminal membranes of the capillary endothelium, enter astrocytic foot processes, and leave the astrocyte through the plasma membrane to finally cross another plasma membrane on its way towards its target nucleus.<br /><br /><strong>GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: </strong>We can expect more transporters being involved in or contributing to in neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disease. Due to their expression in cellular components regulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis, mutations and polymorphisms are expected to impact on negative feedback regulation and hormonal setpoints.

7642269,Molecular characterization and tissue distribution of a new organic anion transporter subtype (oatp3) that transports thyroid hormones and taurocholate and comparison with oatp2,"Two complementary DNAs for the organic anion transporter subtypes oatp2 and oatp3, which transport thyroid hormones as well as taurocholate, were isolated from a rat retina cDNA library. The sequence of oatp2 is identical to that recently reported (Noé, B., Hagenbuch, B., Stieger, B., and Meier, P. J. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 10346-10350), whereas the sequence of oatp3 is novel. oatp3 consists of 670 amino acid residues and exhibits a structural architecture common to the organic anion transporter family, possessing the 12 putative membrane-spanning segments. Oocytes injected with oatp2 and oatp3 cRNAs showed taurocholate uptake in a saturable manner. The oatp2 and oatp3 cRNA-injected oocytes also showed significant uptake of both thyroxine and triiodothyronine. Northern blot and in situ analyses showed that the oatp2 mRNA was widely expressed in neuronal cells of the central nervous system, especially in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and choroid plexus as well as in the retina and liver. The oatp3 mRNA was highly expressed in the kidney and moderately abundant in the retina. This suggests that oatp2 and oatp3 are multifunctional transporters involved in the transport of thyroid hormones in the brain, retina, liver, and kidney.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Often the development of central nervous system drugs needs to be terminated because of their poor brain uptake. We describe a way to achieve large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1)-mediated drug transport into the rat brain. We conjugated ketoprofen to an amino acid l-lysine so that the prodrug could access LAT1. The LAT1-mediated brain uptake of the prodrug was demonstrated with in situ rat brain perfusion technique. The ability of the prodrug to deliver ketoprofen into the site of action, the brain intracellular fluid, was determined combining in vivo and in vitro experiments. A rapid brain uptake from blood and cell uptake was seen both in in situ and in vivo experiments. Therefore, our results show that a prodrug approach can achieve uptake of drugs via LAT1 into the brain intracellular fluid. The distribution of the prodrug in the brain parenchyma and the site of parent drug release in the brain were shown with in vivo and in vitro studies. In addition, our results show that although lysine or ketoprofen are not LAT1-substrates themselves, by combining these molecules, the formed prodrug has affinity for LAT1.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
7642271,OATP and P-glycoprotein transporters mediate the cellular uptake and excretion of fexofenadine,"Fexofenadine, a nonsedating antihistamine, does not undergo significant metabolic biotransformation. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that uptake and efflux transporters could be importantly involved in the drug’s disposition. Utilizing a recombinant vaccinia expression system, members of the organic anion transporting polypeptide family, such as the human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) and rat organic anion transporting polypeptides 1 and 2 (Oatp1 and Oatp2), were found to mediate [14C]fexofenadine cellular uptake. On the other hand, the bile acid transporter human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) and the rat organic cation transporter rOCT1 did not exhibit such activity. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was identified as a fexofenadine efflux transporter, using the LLC-PK1 cell, a polarized epithelial cell line lacking P-gp, and the derivative cell line (L-MDR1), which overexpresses P-gp. In addition, oral and i.v. administration of [14C]fexofenadine to mice lackingmdr1a-encoded P-gp resulted in 5- and 9-fold increases in the drug’s plasma and brain levels, respectively, compared with wild-type mice. Also, a number of drug inhibitors of P-gp were found to be effective inhibitors of OATP. Because OATP transporters and P-gp colocalize in organs of importance to drug disposition such as the liver, their activity provides an explanation for the heretofore unknown mechanism(s) responsible for fexofenadine’s disposition and suggests potentially similar roles in the disposition of other xenobiotics. Processes involved in metabolic biotransformation, especially those mediated by the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases, are frequently critical determinants in the disposition of many drugs. However, it is increasingly recognized that additional processes such as membrane-bound transport systems may also be similarly important. Fexofenadine (Allegra, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Kansas City, MO), a nonsedating antihistamine, has recently been approved for the symptomatic relief of seasonal allergy (Markham and Wagstaff, 1998). This compound is, in fact, the active metabolite of the, until recently, widely prescribed and related drug terfenadine (Seldane, Hoechst Marion Roussel), but has the advantage that it is not cardiotoxic and, therefore, does not cause the rare but potentially fatal adverse reaction associated with certain drug interactions involving terfenadine use (Woosley et al., 1993). Significantly, fexofenadine does not undergo significant biotransformation in humans because 95% of the dose is excreted unchanged either in the urine or feces after biliary excretion (Lippert et al., 1995). Although fexofenadine’s absorption, distribution, and elimination could occur by passive diffusion, this is unlikely because, for example, coadministration of other drugs with fexofenadine results in drug interactions. In the case of the cytochrome P-450 3A inhibitors erythromycin (500 mg every 8 h) and ketoconazole (400 mg once daily), the steady-state plasma levels of fexofenadine increase by 109 and 164%, respectively (product information, Hoechst Marion Roussel). However, the mechanism(s) by which such drugs cause the observed interactions is unknown. Recent biochemical and molecular cloning methodologies have identified a number of transporter proteins expressed in organs of importance in drug disposition, such as the intestine, liver, and kidney. Modulation of the function of such membrane transporters may potentially be responsible for certain drug interactions. In this report, we provide evidence to support the role of human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1drug uptake transporters and the drug efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in the cellular uptake and excretion of fexofenadine. Moreover, we show that drugs that alter P-gp transport activity also affect the function of OATP transporters, suggesting that combined inhibition of both OATP and P-gp may indeed be the mechanistic explanation to account for the observed drug interactions involving fexofenadine.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Unclear_ref_type,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

Mainly synthesized in the live, TTR is transferred in the form of tetramer bound with thyroxine, retinol-binding protein (RBP) and lipoprotein in the blood. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the presence of amyloid substances in the blood by investigated the hemocoelom amyloid in different tissue sections from autopsies such as brain, kidney, heart and aorta arch tissue.

7646631,[Potentializing of tricyclics and serotoninergics by thyroid hormones in resistant depressive disorders],"In response to the increase of resistant depressive disorders and in spite of improved treatments, numerous studies were conducted in the last thirty Years aiming at assessing the pre-morbid thyroid state of depressed patients resistant to well conducted tricyclic treatments. ""Minimal"" thyroid abnormalities were evidenced as well as central thyroid disorders which may not be detected by peripheral-i.e plasmatic- dosages. Regarding the premorbid thyroid status, the hypothesis of subclinical hypothyroidism was considered by many Authors. It is marked by four grades including T3 and T4 decreased levels, basal TSH concentration abnormalities as well as increased TSH response to TRH stimulation, and the presence of antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies. Although, there are different views on the existence or not of these abnormalities, we'll focus our attention on a metaanalysis including six studies. It shows in a population with a resistant depression, 52% of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, against 8 to 17% in patients with simple depression and 5% in the overall population.Similarly, antithyroid antibody levels (group IV hypothyroidism) were significantly higher in depressed patients (9% to 20% against 7,5% in the overall population). For many Years, a central hypothyroidism was hypothesized on the basis of an exhausted T3-T4 transference mechanism and a lowered TRH hypothalamic biodisponibility.In the last Years, new data emerged on the role of transthyretin, a cerebral carrier T4 protein, whose concentration in the CSF was found significantly lower in depressed patients than in a control group, the lowest levels being observed in the most severely depressed. This decreased level of transthyretin would result in a lower central T4 biodisponibility-hence, in view of a T4-T3 desiodation insufficiency, a T3 deficit is observed. A low transthyretin level associated or not to subclinical hypothyroidism could be a factor of depressive vulnerability on one hand, of resistance to tricyclic treatment on the other one. Conversely, subclinical hypothyroidism could be a predictive factor of a good response to a potentializing strategy. The pharmacological mechanisms involved in this potentializing phenomenon are now well known: they consist in an interaction between depression, adrenergic receptors and thyroid hormones biodisponibility. The decreased norepinephrine level observed in depressive patients is associated, in case of increased thyroid hormones biodisponibility, with a higher sensitivity of adre-nergic receptors, mostly betaadrenergic. This seems to underly the recovery process. According to some Authors, the serotoninergic system might be involved in the potentialization of tricyclics by thyroid hormones. We know that in animals with hypothyroidism, the serotonin synthesis is decreased and that the administration of T3 increases the brain levels of serotonin and its 5HIA catabolite. In addition, T3 could correct the down-regulation induced by serotoninergics on beta-adrenergic receptors. On the basis of numerous studies carried out on the potentializing of tricyclics, we suggest practical modalities of treatment - which until today did not materialize in every day practice in the absence of a clear consensus based on statistically reliable data: after four to six weeks of inefficient tricyclic or serotoninergic treatment on a correct dosage testified by plasmatic dosages, it is recommended to initiate a T3 treatment on a effective posology (25 to 50 micrograms per day), which must be reached in 2 or 3 days, except in case of rare and transitory side effects (sweating, shaking, tachycardia, nervousness, anxiety). If the treatment is not rapidly efficient, it must be discontinued in case there is no improvement after 3 weeks. Until today, there is no consensus about the duration of a T3 treatment. It is important to take into account the predictive criteria of good or bad response to a T3 potentialization, since they have direct consequences on the management of depressed patients. For example, a high degree of chronic evolution with resistance to numerous treatments, associated disorders according to the DSM IV axis I and a comorbidity of addiction, point to a bad prognosis of a potentialization treatment. In addition, we'll examine the few recent studies on the potentializing of serotoninergic antidepressant drugs by thyroid hormones.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
7646632,"Film autoradiography identifies unique features of [125I]3,3'5'-(reverse) triiodothyronine transport from blood to brain","1. Steady-state iodothyronine profiles in plasma are composed of thyroid gland-synthesized hormones (mainly thyroxine) and tissue iodothyronine metabolites (mainly triiodothyronine and reverse triiodothyronine) that have entered the bloodstream. The hormones circulate in noncovalently bound complexes with a panoply of carrier proteins. Transthyretin (TTR), the major high-affinity thyroid hormone binding protein in rat plasma, is formed in the liver. It is also actively and independently synthesized in choroid plexus, where its function as a chaperone of thyroid hormones from bloodstream to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is undergoing close scrutiny by several groups of investigators. Because TTR has high-affinity binding sites for both thyroxine and retinol binding protein, its potential role as a mediator of combined thyroid hormone and retinoic acid availability in brain is of further interest. 2. While they are in the free state relative to their binding proteins, iodothyronines in the cerebral circulation are putatively subject to transport across both the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and choroid plexus CSF barrier (CSFB) before entering the brain. Previous autoradiographic studies had already indicated that after intravenous administration the transport mechanisms governing thyroxine and triiodothyronine entry into brain were probably similar, whereas those for reverse triiodothyronine were very different, although the basis for the difference was not established at that time. Intense labeling seen over brain ventricles after intravenous administration of all three iodothyronines suggested that all were subject to transport across the CSFB. 3. To evaluate the role of the BBB and CSFB in determining iodothyronine access to brain parenchyma, autoradiograms prepared after intravenous administration of [125I]-labeled hormones (revealing results of transport across both barriers) were compared with those prepared after intrathecal (icv) hormone injection (reflecting only their capacity to penetrate into the brain after successfully navigating the CSFB). 4. Those studies revealed that thyroxine and triiodothyronine were mainly transported across the BBB. They shared with reverse triiodothyronine a generally similar, limited pattern of penetration from CSF into the brain, with circumventricular organs likely to be the main recipients of iodothyronines (with or without retinol) transported across the CSFB. 5. Analysis of all of the images obtained after intravenous and icv hormone administration clarified the basis for the unique distribution of intravenously injected reverse triiodothyronine. The hormone is excluded by the BBB but may be subject to limited penetration into brain parenchyma via the CSF. 6. Overall the observations single out reverse triiodothyronine as the iodothyronine showing the most distinctive as well as the most limited pattern of transport from blood to brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

We studied the distribution of 125I-labeled EMD-49209 in maternal tissues, intestinal contents, and fetal tissues in rats that were 20 days pregnant (from 1 to 24 h after intravenous injection). The percent dose of EMD decreased quickly with time. In maternal brain no radioactive flavonoid could be detected. EMD was excreted very rapidly from the intestines. In the fetal compartment the percent dose of EMD increased with time; after 24 h it contained 17% of the EMD. The flavonoid was found in all fetal tissues investigated and also in the fetal brain. Because TTR concentrations are high in the fetal rat, especially in the brain, the transfer of flavonoid to the fetal brain might be linked to TTR expression. The presence of flavonoid in the fetal brain raises the possibility of an essential interference of flavonoids with the availability of T4 in the fetal compartment.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7646635,The evolution of transthyretin synthesis in the choroid plexus,"Choroid plexus has the highest concentration of transthyretin (TTR) mRNA in the body, 4.4 microg TTR mRNA/g wet weight tissue, compared with 0.39 microg in the liver. The proportion of TTR to total protein synthesis in choroid plexus is 12%. All newly synthesized TTR is secreted towards the ventricles. Net transfer of T4 occurs only towards the ventricle and depends on ongoing protein synthesis. Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), TTR and albumin form a ""buffering"" system for plasma [T4] because of their overlapping affinities and on/off rates for L-thyroxine (T4)-binding. The individual components of this network determining T4 distribution are functionally highly redundant. Absence of TBG (humans), or TTR (mice), or albumin (humans, rats) is not associated with hypothyroidism. Natural selection is based on small, inheritable alterations improving function. The study of these alterations can identify function. TTR genes were cloned and sequenced for a large number of vertebrate species. Systematic, stepwise changes during evolution occurred only in the N-terminal region, which became shorter and more hydrophilic. Simultaneously, a change in function occurred: TTR affinities for T4 are higher in mammals than in reptiles and birds. L-triiodothyronine (T3) affinities show the opposite trend. This favors site-specific regulation of thyroid hormones by tissue-specific deiodinases in the brain.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
7646639,Structure and expression of the transthyretin gene in the choroid plexus: a model for the study of the mechanism of evolution,"Thyroid hormones are key regulators of brain differentiation and function. They permeate strongly into lipid membranes. However, a substantial portion of thyroid hormone is retained in the intravascular/extracellular compartments by binding to plasma proteins. In the brain, transthyretin is the most important of these proteins. This transthyretin is synthesized in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and exclusively secreted towards the brain. A net movement of thyroid hormones from the blood to the brain ensues. During evolution, transthyretin synthesis in the choroid plexus and the beginnings of a neocortex first appeared at the stage of the stem reptiles. The affinity of transthyretin for thyroxine increased and that for triiodothyronine decreased during evolution. This could augment the importance of deiodination for regulation of metabolism and gene expression by thyroid hormones in the brain. Successive shifts of the splice site at the 5' end of exon 2 of transthyretin precursor mRNA in the 3' direction led to a shortening of the N-terminal sections and to an increase in hydrophilicity of the N-terminal regions of transthyretin. This shift can be explained by a sequence of single base mutations. It could be an example for a molecular mechanism of positive Darwinian evolution. The selection pressure, which led to the expression of the transthyretin gene in the choroid plexus during evolution, might have been the maintenance of thyroid hormone homeostasis in the extracellular compartment of the brain in the presence of the greatly increasing volume of the lipid phase.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

There is currently no noninvasive imaging test available for specific diagnosis. N-[methyl-(11)C]2-(4'-methylamino-phenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ((11)C-PIB) PET is used in the evaluation of brain amyloidosis.

7646642,A transgenic approach to identify thyroxine transporter-expressing structures in brain development,"Transporters are essential in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thyroxine (T4) is transported by solute carrier organic anion transporter 1c1 (SLCO1C1, OATP14) into the adult brain, where T4 is converted to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3). In adults, SLCO1C1 expression is found in two brain barrier structures: the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and choroid plexus. However, little is known about how T4 is transported in the developing brain, when the BBB is not yet completely formed. We employed bacterial artificial chromosome recombineering to generate transgenic mice carrying Cre recombinase in the Slco1c1 locus (Slco1c1-Cre mice). In Slco1c1-Cre mice Cre was expressed at the sites that have been previously reported for SLCO1C1 in adults. To trace Cre expression during development, we crossed Slco1c1-Cre transgenic mice with Rosa26 reporter mice. β-galactosidase staining showed Cre activity in neurones of various brain structures, such as cortical layer 2/3 and the hippocampus, suggesting transient Slco1c1 expression during brain development. At embryonic day15, SLCO1C1 was expressed at the same site as TBR2, a marker of neuronal progenitors. Neurones that express SLCO1C1 during their development could be T4 sensitive. In support of this hypothesis, hypothyroxinaemia induced by propylthiouracil treatment of dams decreased the number of β-galactosidase-positive neurones in cortical layer 2/3 of newborn Slco1c1-Cre/Rosa26 mice. In conclusion, by generating Slco1c1-Cre transgenic mice, we demonstrated that SLCO1C1 is expressed in the neuronal cell lineage during brain development.

7651059,Thyroid hormone metabolism in a transthyretin-null mouse strain,"Transthyretin (TTR) is the principal carrier of thyroid hormones in rodent plasma and the major protein synthesized by the choroid plexus. Mice lacking TTR generated by targeted disruption (Episkopou, V., Maeda, S., Nishiguchi, S., Shimada, K., Gaitanaris, G. A., Gottesman, M. E., and Robertson, E. J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 2375-2379) had a 50% decrease in total thyroxine (T4) plasma levels but had normal free hormone levels as compared to wild-type mice. In the mutant serum there was increased T4 binding to thyroxine-binding globulin. Thyroxine-binding globulin mRNA levels were the same in mutant and wild-type animals. Wild-type serum depleted of TTR also presented increased T4 binding to thyroxine-binding globulin, suggesting that TTR competes with thyroxine-binding globulin for T4 binding. Total and free triiodothyronine and thyrotoropin-stimulating hormone levels were not affected by the absence of TTR. Liver deiodinase-I activity, mRNA levels, and brain deiodinase-II activity were normal in the mutant mice, suggesting that the absence of TTR does not affect tissue thyroid hormone content. The low T4 levels found in the mutant mice sera cannot be accounted for by increased glucuronidation because the liver activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase was not affected in the TTR-deficient mice. We concluded that transthyretin-deficient mice are euthyroid in the absence of the major plasma T4 carrier. We ascribed this to the normal free hormone levels in the serum of the mutant mice. Our data, therefore, strongly supported the free hormone hypothesis for thyroxine uptake (Mendel, C. M. (1989) Endocr.

Recently, several transporters capable of thyroid hormone transport have been identified. Functional expression studies using Xenopus laevis oocytes have demonstrated that organic anion transporters (e.g., OATPs), and L-type amino acid transporters (LATs) facilitate thyroid hormone uptake. Among these, OATP1C1 has a high affinity and specificity for thyroxine (T(4)). OATP1C1 is expressed in capillaries throughout the brain, suggesting it is critical for transport of T(4) over the blood-brain barrier. We have also characterized a member of the monocarboxylate transporter family, MCT8, as a very active and specific thyroid hormone transporter. Human MCT8 shows preference for T(3) as the ligand. MCT8 is highly expressed in liver and brain but is also widely distributed in other tissues. The MCT8 gene is located on the X chromosome.

7651062,The organic anion transport inhibitor probenecid increases brain concentrations of the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide,"Bumetanide is increasingly being used for experimental treatment of brain disorders, including neonatal seizures, epilepsy, and autism, because the neuronal Na-K-Cl cotransporter NKCC1, which is inhibited by bumetanide, is implicated in the pathophysiology of such disorders. However, use of bumetanide for treatment of brain disorders is associated with problems, including poor brain penetration and systemic adverse effects such as diuresis, hypokalemic alkalosis, and hearing loss. The poor brain penetration is thought to be related to its high ionization rate and plasma protein binding, which restrict brain entry by passive diffusion, but more recently brain efflux transporters have been involved, too. Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (OATP2) were suggested to mediate bumetanide brain efflux, but direct proof is lacking. Because MRP4, OAT3, and OATP2 can be inhibited by probenecid, we studied whether this drug alters brain levels of bumetanide in mice. Probenecid (50 mg/kg) significantly increased brain levels of bumetanide up to 3-fold; however, it also increased its plasma levels, so that the brain:plasma ratio (~0.015-0.02) was not altered. Probenecid markedly increased the plasma half-life of bumetanide, indicating reduced elimination of bumetanide most likely by inhibition of OAT-mediated transport of bumetanide in the kidney. However, the diuretic activity of bumetanide was not reduced by probenecid. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the clinically available drug probenecid can be used to increase brain levels of bumetanide and decrease its elimination, which could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of brain disorders.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
7651065,The expression of thyroid hormone transporters in the human fetal cerebral cortex during early development and in N-Tera-2 neurodifferentiation,"Associations of neurological impairment with mutations in the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter, MCT8, and with maternal hypothyroxinaemia, suggest that THs are crucial for human fetal brain development. It has been postulated that TH transporters regulate the cellular supply of THs within the fetal brain during development. This study describes the expression of TH transporters in the human fetal cerebral cortex (7–20 weeks gestation) and during retinoic acid induced neurodifferentiation of the human N-Tera-2 (NT2) cell line, in triiodothyronine (T3) replete and T3-depleted media. Compared with adult cortex, mRNAs encoding OATP1A2, OATP1C1, OATP3A1 variant 2, OATP4A1, LAT2 and CD98 were reduced in fetal cortex at different gestational ages, whilst mRNAs encoding MCT8, MCT10, OATP3A1 variant 1 and LAT1 were similar. From the early first trimester, immunohistochemistry localised MCT8 and MCT10 to the microvasculature and to undifferentiated CNS cells. With neurodifferentiation, NT2 cells demonstrated declining T3 uptake, accompanied by reduced expressions of MCT8, LAT1, CD98 and OATP4A1. T3 depletion significantly reduced MCT10 and LAT2 mRNA expression at specific time points during neurodifferentiation but there were no effects upon T3 uptake, neurodifferentiation marker expression or neurite lengths and branching. MCT8 repression also did not affect NT2 neurodifferentiation. In conclusion, many TH transporters are expressed in the human fetal cerebral cortex from the first trimester, which could regulate cellular TH supply during early development. However, human NT2 neurodifferentiation is not dependent upon T3 or MCT8 and there were no compensatory changes to promote T3 uptake in a T3-depleted environment.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7651079,Genetics and phenomics of thyroid hormone transport by MCT8,"Thyroid hormone (TH) is crucial for the development of different organs, in particular the brain, as disturbances in TH supply cause severe neurological abnormalities.

Worldwide >45 families have now been identified with MCT8 mutations. Most MCT8 mutations result in a complete loss of TH transport function when tested in vitro, but some mutations show significant residual activity and are associated with a somewhat milder clinical phenotype.

This syndrome is characterized by congenital hypotonia that progresses to spasticity with severe psychomotor delays. Affected males also present with muscle hypoplasia, generalized muscle weakness, and limited speech. Importantly, these patients have elevated serum levels of free T(3), low to below normal serum levels of free T(4), and levels of thyroid stimulating hormone that are within the normal range.

7973128,[Electrophoresis of cerebrospinal fluid proteins in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease],"<strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Cerebral infarction (CI) increases vascular permeability because of a torrent of molecular events that take place. It frequently leads to oedema, haemorrhage and neuronal death. Free radicals and proteases are also formed, which cause lesions in the blood vessels, and microvascular integrity is lost through degradation of the basal lamina and the extracellular matrix. As a result rupture of the blood brain barrier takes place. AIMS. To compare the electrophoretograms of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD) with those of controls and to link the alterations in the proteinogram with the ICVD subtypes.<br /><br /><strong>PATIENTS AND METHODS: </strong>The CSF of 55 controls and 136 patients with ICVD was examined. The total protein (TP) concentration was determined and a polyacrylamide gel electrophoretogram was produced using Coomassie blue stain. Parallel to this, serum was prepared for haptoglobin staining.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The TP in patients CSF rose to a significantly higher level than that of controls. Blood brain barrier damage (BBBD) was observed in 28.7% of the patients studied with CI and in 10.3% in transient ischemic attacks (TIA), while 16.2% presented oligoclonal bands. There was a difference between the two sexes: men were found to have higher TP levels, lower percentages of prealbumin 1 and more BBBD than women.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>BBBD is more frequent in infarctions than in TIA, and is predominant in men with thrombotic cerebral infarction.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7974188,Oligodendroglial Lineage Cells in Thyroid Hormone-Deprived Conditions,"Oligodendrocytes are supporting glial cells that ensure the metabolism and homeostasis of neurons with specific synaptic axoglial interactions in the central nervous system. These require key myelinating glial trophic signals important for growth and metabolism. Thyroid hormone (TH) is one such trophic signal that regulates oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination, and oligodendroglial synaptic dynamics via either genomic or nongenomic pathways. The intracellular and extracellular transport of TH is facilitated by a specific transmembrane transporter known as the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8). Dysfunction of the MCT8 due to mutation, inhibition, or downregulation during brain development leads to inherited hypomyelination, which manifests as psychomotor retardation in the X-linked inherited Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS). In particular, oligodendroglial-specific MCT8 deficiency may restrict the intracellular T3 availability, culminating in deficient metabolic communication between the oligodendrocytes and the neurons they ensheath, potentially promulgating neurodegenerative adult diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on the therapeutic effects exhibited by TH in various preclinical studies, particularly related to its remyelinating potential, TH has now entered the initial stages of a clinical trial to test the therapeutic efficacy in relapsing-remitting MS patients (NCT02506751). However, TH analogs, such as DITPA or Triac, may well serve as future therapeutic options to rescue mature oligodendrocytes and/or promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation in an environment of MCT8 deficiency within the CNS. This review outlines the therapeutic strategies to overcome the differentiation blockade of oligodendrocyte precursors and maintain mature axoglial interactions in TH-deprived conditions.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974191,Central Hypothyroidism Impairs Heart Rate Stability and Prevents Thyroid Hormone-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy and Pyrexia,"Background: Tachycardia, cardiac hypertrophy, and elevated body temperature are major signs of systemic hyperthyroidism, which are considered to reflect the excessive thyroid hormone (TH) action in the respective peripheral tissues. However, recent observations indicate that the central actions of TH also contribute substantially to cardiovascular regulation and thermogenesis. Methods: In this study, we dissect the individual contributions of peripheral TH action versus the central effects in body temperature regulation and cardiovascular functions by taking advantage of mice lacking the TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) (M/O double knock-out [dko]), which exhibit elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels while their brain is in a profoundly hypothyroid state. We compared these animals with wild-type (WT) mice that were treated orally with T3 to achieve similarly elevated serum T3 levels, but are centrally hyperthyroid. For the studies, we used radiotelemetry, infrared thermography, gene expression profiling, Western blot analyses, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) assays. Results: Our analyses revealed mild hyperthermia and cardiac hypertrophy in T3-treated WT mice but not in M/O dko animals, suggesting that central actions of TH are required for these hyperthyroid phenotypes. Although the average heart rate was unaffected in either model, the M/O dko exhibited an altered heart rate frequency distribution with tachycardic bursts in active periods and bradycardic episodes during resting time, demonstrating that the stabilization of heart rate by the autonomic nervous system can be impaired in centrally hypothyroid animals. Conclusions: Our studies unravel distinct phenotypical traits of hyperthyroidism that depend on an intact central nervous system, and provide valuable insight into the cardiovascular pathology of the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a condition caused by the lack of MCT8 in humans.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974193,Atypical mouse cerebellar development is caused by ectopic expression of the forkhead box transcription factor HNF-3beta,"To assess the role of hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3beta) in hepatocyte-specific gene transcription, we reported the characterization of the liver phenotype with transgenic mice in which the -3-kb transthyretin (TTR) promoter functioned to increase HNF-3beta expression. During breeding of the TTR-HNF-3beta transgenic mice we noticed that they displayed severe ataxia. In this study, we describe the analysis of our transgenic cerebellar phenotype and demonstrate that ectopic expression of HNF-3beta disrupted cerebellar morphogenesis and caused reduction in cerebellar size. In postnatal cerebellum, the HNF-3beta transgene expression pattern is colocalized to glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cerebellar astrocytes and Bergmann glial cells. As a result of protracted expression, the transgenic cerebella are impaired in terms of astrocyte dispersal and formation of Bergmann glial cell processes. This caused a disruption in neuronal cell migration to the cortical laminar layers and Purkinje dendritic arbor maturation, thus leading to diminished foliation. Differential hybridization of cDNA arrays was used to identify altered expression of cerebellar genes, which is consistent with the observed defect in transgenic cerebellar morphogenesis and size as well as glial maturation. These include diminished expression of the brain lipid-binding protein, which is required for glial morphological differentiation, and the basic helix-loop-helix NeuroD/Beta2 and homeodomain Engrailed-2 transcription factors, which are required for normal cerebellar morphogenesis and foliation. Undetectable levels of ataxia telangiectasia (ATM), which is required for proper development of the Purkinje dendritic arbor, were found in postnatal transgenic cerebella. Furthermore, the transgenic cerebella displayed levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 elevated to 22 times greater than those measured for wild-type cerebella, an elevation consistent with the reduction in transgenic cerebellar size.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974195,Regulation of Gene Expression by Thyroid Hormone in Primary Astrocytes: Factors Influencing the Genomic Response,"Astrocytes mediate the action of thyroid hormone in the brain on other neural cells through the production of the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) from its precursor thyroxine. T3 has also many effects on the astrocytes in vivo and in culture, but whether these actions are directly mediated by transcriptional regulation is not clear. In this work, we have analyzed the genomic response to T3 of cultured astrocytes isolated from the postnatal mouse cerebral cortex using RNA sequencing. Cultured astrocytes express relevant genes of thyroid hormone metabolism and action encoding type 2 deiodinase (Dio2), Mct8 transporter (Slc16a2), T3 receptors (Thra1 and Thrb), and nuclear corepressor (Ncor1) and coactivator (Ncoa1). T3 changed the expression of 668 genes (4.5% of expressed genes), of which 117 were responsive to T3 in the presence of cycloheximide. The Wnt and Notch pathways were downregulated at the posttranscriptional level. Comparison with the effect of T3 on astrocyte-enriched genes in mixed cerebrocortical cultures isolated from fetal cortex revealed that the response to T3 is influenced by the degree of astrocyte maturation and that, in agreement with its physiological effects, T3 promotes the transition between the fetal and adult patterns of gene expression.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974196,From zebrafish to human: A comparative approach to elucidate the role of the thyroid hormone transporter MCT8 during brain development,"Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) facilitates transmembrane transport of thyroid hormones (THs) ensuring their action on gene expression during vertebrate neurodevelopment. A loss of MCT8 in humans results in severe psychomotor deficits associated with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS). However, where and when exactly a lack of MCT8 causes the neurological manifestations remains unclear because of the varying expression pattern of MCT8 between specific brain regions and cells. Here, we elaborate on the animal models that have been generated to elucidate the mechanisms underlying MCT8-deficient brain development. The absence of a clear neurological phenotype in Mct8 knockout mice made it clear that a single species would not suffice. The evolutionary conservation of TH action on neurodevelopment as well as the components regulating TH signalling however offers the opportunity to answer different aspects of MCT8 function in brain development using different vertebrate species. Moreover, the plethora of tools for genome editing available today facilitates gene silencing in these animals as well. Studies in the recently generated mct8-deficient zebrafish and Mct8/Oatp1c1 double knockout mice have put forward the current paradigm of impaired TH uptake at the level of the blood-brain barrier during peri- and postnatal development as being the main pathophysiological mechanism of AHDS. RNAi vector-based, cell-specific induction of MCT8 knockdown in the chicken embryo points to an additional function of MCT8 at the level of the neural progenitors during early brain development. Future studies including also additional in vivo models like Xenopus or in vitro approaches such as induced pluripotent stem cells will continue to help unravelling the exact role of MCT8 in developmental events. In the end, this multispecies approach will lead to a unifying thesis regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the neurological phenotype in AHDS patients.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974197,Impact of monocarboxylate transporter-8 deficiency on the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in mice,"In patients, inactivating mutations in the gene encoding the thyroid hormone-transporting monocarboxylate transporter 8 (Mct8) are associated with severe mental and neurological deficits and disturbed thyroid hormone levels. The latter phenotype characterized by high T3 and low T4 serum concentrations is replicated in Mct8 knockout (ko) mice, indicating that MCT8 deficiency interferes with thyroid hormone production and/or metabolism. Our studies of Mct8 ko mice indeed revealed increased thyroidal T3 and T4 concentrations without overt signs of a hyperactive thyroid gland. However, upon TSH stimulation Mct8 ko mice showed decreased T4 and increased T3 secretion compared with wild-type littermates. Moreover, similar changes in the thyroid hormone secretion pattern were observed in Mct8/Trhr1 double-ko mice, which are characterized by normal serum T3 levels and normal hepatic and renal D1 expression in the presence of very low T4 serum concentrations. These data strongly indicate that absence of Mct8 in the thyroid gland affects thyroid hormone efflux by shifting the ratio of the secreted hormones toward T3. To test this hypothesis, we generated Mct8/Pax8 double-mutant mice, which in addition to Mct8 lack a functional thyroid gland and are therefore completely athyroid. Following the injection of these animals with either T4 or T3, serum analysis revealed T3 concentrations similar to those observed in Pax8 ko mice under thyroid hormone replacement, indicating that indeed increased thyroidal T3 secretion in Mct8 ko mice represents an important pathogenic mechanism leading to the high serum T3 levels.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974198,Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate inhibits expression and internalization of transthyretin in human placental trophoblastic cells,"During pregnancy, fetal thyroid hormones (THs) are dependent on maternal placental transport and their physiological level is crucial for normal fetal neurodevelopment. Earlier research has shown that Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) disrupts thyroid function and THs homeostasis in pregnant women and fetuses, and affects placental THs transport. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study, therefore, aimed to systematically investigate the potential mechanisms of DEHP-induced disruption in the placental THs transport using two human placental trophoblastic cells, HTR-8/SVneo cells and JEG-3 cells. While the exposure of DEHP at the doses of 0-400 μM for 24 h did not affect cell viability, we found reduced consumption of T3 and T4 in the culture medium of HTR-8/Svneo cells treated with DEHP at 400 μM. DEHP treatment did not affect T3 uptake and the expression of monocarboxylate transporters 8 (MCT8) and organic anion transporters 1C1 (OATP1C1). However, DEHP significantly inhibited transthyretin (TTR) internalization, down-regulated TTR, deiodinase 2 (DIO2), and thyroid hormone receptors mRNA expression and protein levels, and up-regulated deiodinase 3 (DIO3) protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that DEHP acts on placental trophoblast cells, inhibits its TTR internalization, down-regulates TTR expression and affects the expression of DIO2, DIO3, and thyroid hormone receptor. These may be the mechanisms by which PAEs affects THs transport through placental.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974200,Functional polarity of microvascular brain endothelial cells supported by neurovascular unit computational model of large neutral amino acid homeostasis,"The homeostatic regulation of large neutral amino acid (LNAA) concentration in the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) is essential for proper brain function. LNAA passage into the brain is primarily mediated by the complex and dynamic interactions between various solute carrier (SLC) transporters expressed in the neurovascular unit (NVU), among which SLC7A5/LAT1 is considered to be the major contributor in microvascular brain endothelial cells (MBEC). The LAT1-mediated trans-endothelial transport of LNAAs, however, could not be characterized precisely by available in vitro and in vivo standard methods so far. To circumvent these limitations, we have incorporated published in vivo data of rat brain into a robust computational model of NVU-LNAA homeostasis, allowing us to evaluate hypotheses concerning LAT1-mediated trans-endothelial transport of LNAAs across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We show that accounting for functional polarity of MBECs with either asymmetric LAT1 distribution between membranes and/or intrinsic LAT1 asymmetry with low intraendothelial binding affinity is required to reproduce the experimentally measured brain ISF response to intraperitoneal (IP) L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine injection. On the basis of these findings, we have also investigated the effect of IP administrated L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine on the dynamics of LNAAs in MBECs, astrocytes and neurons. Finally, the computational model was shown to explain the trans-stimulation of LNAA uptake across the BBB observed upon ISF perfusion with a competitive LAT1 inhibitor.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974202,"Maternal thyroid hormone deficiency affects the fetal neocorticogenesis by reducing the proliferating pool, rate of neurogenesis and indirect neurogenesis","Neuronal progenitor cell proliferation and their optimum number are indispensable for neurogenesis, which is determined by cell cycle length and cell cycle quitting rate of the dividing progenitors. These processes are tightly orchestrated by transcription factors like Tbr2, Pax6, and E2f-1. Radial glia and intermediate progenitor cells (IPC) through direct and indirect neurogenesis maintain surface area and neocortical thickness during development. Here we show that fetal neurogenesis is maternal thyroid hormone (MTH) dependent with differential effect on direct and indirect neurogenesis. MTH deficiency (MTHD) impairs direct neurogenesis through initial down-regulation of Pax6 and diminished progenitor pool with recovery even before the onset of fetal thyroid function (FTF). However, persistent decrease in Tbr2 positive IPCs, diminished NeuN positivity in layers I-III of neocortex, and reduced cortical thickness indicate a non-compensatory impairment in indirect neurogenesis. TH deficiency causes disrupted cell cycle kinetics and deranged neurogenesis. It specifically affects indirect neurogenesis governed by intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). TH replacement in hypothyroid dams partially restored the rate of neurogenesis in the fetal neocortex. Taken together we describe a novel role of maternal TH in promoting IPCs derived neuronal differentiation in developing neo-cortex. We have also shown for the first time that ventricular zone progenitors are TH responsive as they express its receptor, TR alpha-1, transporters (MCT8) and deiodinases.

7974203,"Organ-specific effects of tiratricol: A thyroid hormone analog with hepatic, not pituitary, superagonist effects","Tiratricol has been used to suppress pituitary TSH secretion, with reported attenuation of extrapituitary thyromimetic effects. A randomized, double-blind trial was performed to define precisely the tissue-specific thyromimetic actions of tiratricol. Ten athyreotic patients, treated for thyroid carcinoma, were randomly assigned to receive L-T4 sodium 0.7 micrograms/kg daily and either tiratricol 10 micrograms/kg or placebo twice daily. The daily dose of L-T4 was increased by 25-50 micrograms increments until the TRH-stimulated TSH level was less than 0.1 mU/L. After measurement of biochemical and physiological parameters of thyroid hormone actions, patients crossed treatment groups. Patients required 46% less L-T4 to achieve equivalent TSH suppression when taking tiratricol. Hepatic effects were enhanced by tiratricol administration, with significant increases in sex hormone binding globulin and ferritin concentrations, 14% and 37%, respectively. Levels of serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B were reduced by 7%, 10%, and 13%, respectively, during tiratricol therapy. Triglyceride levels also declined, but there were no changes of high density lipoprotein cholesterol or apolipoproteins AI and AII. Resting metabolic rate, body weight, urea nitrogen excretion, and symptoms did not differ between the two treatment regimens. Cardiovascular function, as reflected by mean arterial pressure and pulse wave arrival time, was not different during tiratricol therapy. Skeletal metabolic activity was affected by tiratricol, with marked elevation of osteocalcin without significant change in serum calcium, PTH, and urinary calcium and hydroxyproline excretion.

7974206,"Multiple blood-brain barrier transport mechanisms limit bumetanide accumulation, and therapeutic potential, in the mammalian brain","There is accumulating evidence that bumetanide, which has been used over decades as a potent loop diuretic, also exerts effects on brain disorders, including autism, neonatal seizures, and epilepsy, which are not related to its effects on the kidney but rather mediated by inhibition of the neuronal Na-K-Cl cotransporter isoform NKCC1. However, following systemic administration, brain levels of bumetanide are typically below those needed to inhibit NKCC1, which critically limits its clinical use for treating brain disorders. Recently, active efflux transport at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been suggested as a process involved in the low brain:plasma ratio of bumetanide, but it is presently not clear which transporters are involved. Understanding the processes explaining the poor brain penetration of bumetanide is needed for developing strategies to improve the brain delivery of this drug. In the present study, we administered probenecid and more selective inhibitors of active transport carriers at the BBB directly into the brain of mice to minimize the contribution of peripheral effects on the brain penetration of bumetanide. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with mouse organic anion transporter 3 (Oat3)-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells were performed to study the interaction of bumetanide, bumetanide derivatives, and several known inhibitors of Oats on Oat3-mediated transport. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that the uptake and efflux of bumetanide at the BBB is much more complex than previously thought. It seems that both restricted passive diffusion and active efflux transport, mediated by Oat3 but also organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp) Oatp1a4 and multidrug resistance protein 4 explain the extremely low brain concentrations that are achieved after systemic administration of bumetanide, limiting the use of this drug for targeting abnormal expression of neuronal NKCC1 in brain diseases.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974207,The monocarboxylate transporter family--role and regulation,"Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) isoforms 1-4 catalyze the proton-linked transport of monocarboxylates such as L-lactate across the plasma membrane, whereas MCT8 and MCT10 are thyroid hormone and aromatic amino acid transporters, respectively. The importance of MCTs is becoming increasingly evident as their extensive physiological and pathological roles are revealed. MCTs 1-4 play essential metabolic roles in most tissues with their distinct properties, expression profile, and subcellular localization matching the particular metabolic needs of a tissue. Important metabolic roles include energy metabolism in the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, tumor cells, and T-lymphocyte activation, gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney, spermatogenesis, bowel metabolism of short-chain fatty acids, and drug transport. MCT8 is essential for thyroid hormone transport across the blood-brain barrier. Genetic perturbation of MCT function may be involved in disease states such as pancreatic β-cell malfunction (inappropriate MCT1 expression), chronic fatigue syndromes (impairment of muscle MCT function), and psychomotor retardation (MCT8 mutation). MCT expression can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Of particular importance is the upregulation of muscle MCT1 expression in response to training and MCT4 expression in response to hypoxia. The latter is mediated by hypoxia inducible factor 1α and often observed in tumor cells that rely almost entirely on glycolysis for their energy provision. The recent discovery of potent and specific MCT1 inhibitors that prevent proliferation of T-lymphocytes confirms that MCTs may be promising pharmacological targets including for cancer chemotherapy.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The aim of the present study was to determine the in vivo and brain pharmacokinetics of two perforin inhibitors and their LAT1-utilizing prodrugs 1 and 2. In addition, the brain uptake mechanism and entry into primary mouse cortical neurons and astrocytes were evaluated. After 23 μmol/kg i.p. bolus injection, the prodrugs' unbound area under the concentration curve in brain was 0.3 nmol/g × min, whereas the parent drugs could not reach the brain. The unbound brain concentrations of the prodrugs after 100 μM in situ mouse brain perfusion were 521.4 ± 46.9 and 126.9 ± 19.9 pmol/g for prodrugs 1 and 2, respectively. The combination of competing transporter substrates for LAT1, l-tryptophan, and for organic anion transporting polypeptides, probenecid, decreased the brain concentrations to 352.4 ± 44.5 and 70.9 ± 7.0 pmol/g, respectively. In addition, in vitro uptake studies showed that at 100 μM prodrug 1 had 3.4-fold and 4.5-fold higher uptake rate into neurons and astrocytes, respectively, compared to its parent drug.

Simultaneous administration of the thyroid hormones inhibits all these reactions. The simultaneous administration of perphenazine (a dopaminergic neurone inhibitor) potentiates the adenohypophyseal and ceruloplasmin reaction, but does not modify the hypothalamic ascorbic acid reaction.

In this study, we investigated the transport mechanisms of tryptophan in brain capillary endothelial (TR-BBB) cell lines and motor neuron-like (NSC-34) cell lines. The uptake of [3H]l-tryptophan was stereospecific, and concentration- and sodium-dependent in TR-BBB cell lines. Transporter inhibitors and several neuroprotective drugs inhibited [3H]l-tryptophan uptake by TR-BBB cell lines. Gabapentin and baclofen exerted a competitive inhibitory effect on [3H]l-tryptophan uptake. Additionally, l-tryptophan uptake was time- and concentration-dependent in both NSC-34 wild type (WT) and mutant type (MT) cell lines, with a lower transporter affinity and higher capacity in MT than in WT cell lines. Gene knockdown of LAT1 (l-type amino acid transporter 1) and CAT1 (cationic amino acid transporter 1) demonstrated that LAT1 is primarily involved in the transport of [3H]l-tryptophan in both TR-BBB and NSC-34 cell lines. In addition, tryptophan uptake was increased by TR-BBB cell lines but decreased by NSC-34 cell lines after pro-inflammatory cytokine pre-treatment. However, treatment with neuroprotective drugs ameliorated tryptophan uptake by NSC-34 cell lines after inflammatory cytokines pretreatment.

7974212,Modeling the Biochemical Phenotype of MCT8 Mutations In Vitro: Resolving a Troubling Inconsistency,"Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a severe genetic disease caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene. MCT8 mediates transport of thyroid hormones in and out of cells, which is thought to play a pivotal role for embryonic and postnatal development of the human brain. Disconcertingly, MCT8R271H leads to a severe form of AHDS but shows residual transport activity when expressed in several types of cultured cells. Here we try to determine the mechanism behind the transport function of MCT8R271H found in overexpressing cell systems. Mutations of Arg271 were introduced into human MCT8 and stably transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and the human-derived cell line JEG1. Radioactive thyroid hormone-uptake experiments were performed to analyze the pH-dependent effect of the mutation on transport activity. Arg271His transports thyroid hormones in and out of cells in a pH-dependent manner. Its transport activity increases below pH 7.3 and is clearly diminished at physiological pH. The Michaelis constant of the mutant is unaltered, whereas the maximum velocity is reduced. The expression of Arg271His in JEG1 cells leads to an almost nonfunctional transporter at physiological pH replicating the human phenotype for this mutant in vitro and demonstrates, again, that mutant MCT8 activity depends on cellular background. The protonation of His271 at acidic pH restores activity of the mutant protein, which is not active in its deprotonated form at physiological pH. Thus, experimental parameters must be controlled carefully when modeling MCT8 deficiency in cells.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7246450,L-type amino acid transporter 1 utilizing prodrugs of ferulic acid revealed structural features supporting the design of prodrugs for brain delivery,"Ferulic acid (FA), a natural antioxidant, has displayed some potential benefits against Alzheimer's disease. However, due to its poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation and low bioavailability, the clinical use of FA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease has been limited. In the present study, we applied an L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1) - mediated prodrug approach to deliver FA into the mouse brain and synthetized three novel LAT1-utilizing prodrugs of FA. We used a previously proposed methodology for the development of transporter-utilizing prodrugs and investigated their cellular uptake via LAT1 in vitro in ARPE-19 cells, BBB permeation using in situ perfusion in mice and pharmacokinetics after a single i.p. injection in mice; and compared the findings to our previous structure-pharmacokinetics relationship analysis of LAT1-utilizing prodrugs. In addition, we evaluated interspecies differences in the bioconversion rate of the ester-based prodrug in mouse and human plasma and liver S9 subcellular fraction. It was found that amide-based prodrugs with an aromatic ring in the promoiety were effectively bound to LAT1 and utilized the transporter for cellular uptake in vitro and crossed the BBB after in situ perfusion in mice. In addition, the amide prodrug with the promoiety directly conjugated in the meta-position to FA was bioconverted to the parent drug in mouse brain. Importantly, the study showed that the analogous ester-based prodrug did bind to LAT1 but did not utilize the transporter for cellular uptake in ARPE-19 cells. However, the presence of an ester linker between the prodrug and the parent drug promoted favorable bioconversion properties in human in comparison to mouse tissues in vitro i.e. the ester prodrug showed higher stability in human plasma (75% of intact prodrug in 5 h) and liver S9 subcellular fraction (181 min) in comparison to mouse plasma (t½ 2.6 min) and liver S9 fraction (t½ 23.3 min), suggesting that ester-based prodrugs may offer potential benefits in humans. In conclusion, switching from an amide to ester linker between the promoiety and the parent drug can affect the bioconversion rate of prodrugs in different species as well as influencing their cellular uptake mechanism. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the effective application of structure-pharmacokinetic relationships and screening methodology for developing LAT1-utilizing prodrugs and highlighted the importance of evaluating the biotransformation of parent drug and prodrugs in different species.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974214,The movement of thyroid hormones in the central nervous system,"Thyroid hormones in the central nervous system (CNS) present a number of complexities which include a marked difference in hormone effects on the developing brain compared to the mature brain, extensive regional heterogeneity within the brain, and alternate ways by which the hormones gain entry to the CNS and its cells. Furthermore, most of the T3 found within brain cells is derived from the T4 that they have accumulated. This brief review concerns the movement of the thyroid hormones as they leave the bloodstream and make their way into and through the CNS. There are many sites for potential control of thyroid hormone transport into the central nervous system. The blood brain barrier and the choroid plexus may work in tandem as two parallel resistors subjected to different controls to maintain brain interstitial levels of thyroid hormone at near constant levels. Thyroid hormone may enter neurons directly from the interstitial fluid or indirectly from the glial cells. Nonetheless, both neurons, perhaps at the synaptosome, and glial cells are capable of transporting and concentrating thyroid hormones at physiological levels.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

They also have severe neurodevelopmental defects resulting from cerebral hypothyroidism, most likely due to impaired TH transport across the brain barriers. The use of TH analogs, such as triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC), that can potentially access the brain in the absence of MCT8 and restore at least a subset of cerebral TH actions could improve the neurological defects in these patients. We hypothesized that direct administration of TRIAC into the brain by intracerebroventricular delivery to mice lacking MCT8 could bypass the restriction at the brain barriers and mediate TH action without causing hypermetabolism. We found that intracerebroventricular administration of therapeutic doses of TRIAC does not increase further plasma triiodothyronine or further decrease plasma thyroxine levels and does not alter TH content in the cerebral cortex. Although TRIAC content increased in the brain, it did not induce TH-mediated actions on selected target genes. Our data suggest that intracerebroventricular delivery of TRIAC has the ability to target the brain in the absence of MCT8 and should be further investigated to address its potential therapeutic use in MCT8 deficiency.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

MCT8 mutations cause an X-linked syndromic disorder known as Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) that is characterized by severe psychomotor delays, abnormal thyroid function, and hypomyelinated leukodystrophies. We identified 2 AHDS patients with developmental delays, truncal hypotonia, and spastic paraplegia. These patients presented with psychomotor retardation and characteristic thyroid function abnormalities, such as elevated T3 and low T4 levels. Direct MCT8 sequencing identified heterozygous mutations in each patient: p.I114N and p.A224V, respectively. Because it is difficult to suspect AHDS solely according to neurological features, thyroid function, including the T3 level, should be screened in male patients with X-linked mental retardation.

7974186,The Chemical Chaperone Phenylbutyrate Rescues MCT8 Mutations Associated With Milder Phenotypes in Patients With Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome,"Mutations in the thyroid hormone transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) prevent appropriate entry of thyroid hormones into brain cells during development and cause severe mental retardation in affected patients. The current treatment options are thyromimetic compounds that enter the brain independently of MCT8. Some MCT8-deficient patients (e.g., those carrying MCT8delF501) will not be as severely affected as most others. We have shown that the MCT8delF501 protein has decreased protein stability but important residual function once it reaches the plasma membrane. We were able to rescue protein expression and the function of MCT8delF501 in a Madin-Darby canine kidney cell model by application of the chemical chaperone sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB), a drug that has been used to treat patients with cystic fibrosis and urea cycle defects for extended periods of time. In the present study, we have extended our previous study and report on the NaPB-dependent rescue of a series of other pathogenic MCT8 mutants associated with milder patient phenotypes. We show that NaPB can functionally rescue the expression and activities of Ser194Phe, Ser290Phe, Leu434Trp, Arg445Cys, Leu492Pro, and Leu568Pro mutations in MCT8 in a dose-dependent manner. The soy isoflavone genistein, a dietary supplement, which was effective in MCT8delF501, was also effective in increasing the expression and transport of these MCT8 mutants; however, the effect size differed among mutants. Kinetic analyses revealed that the Michaelis constants of the mutants toward the primary substrate 3,3',5-triiodothyronine were not much different from the wild-type value, suggesting that these mutants are not impaired in their interaction with substrate but rather destabilized by the mutation and degraded.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973176,4F2hc stabilizes GLUT1 protein and increases glucose transport activity,"Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is widely distributed throughout various tissues and contributes to insulin-independent basal glucose uptake. Using a split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid system, we newly identified 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) as a membrane protein interacting with GLUT1. Though 4F2hc reportedly forms heterodimeric complexes between amino acid transporters, such as LAT1 and LAT2, and regulates amino acid uptake, we investigated the effects of 4F2hc on GLUT1 expression and the associated glucose uptake. First, FLAG-tagged 4F2hc and hemagglutinin-tagged GLUT1 were overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and their association was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. The green fluorescent protein-tagged 4F2hc and DsRed-tagged GLUT1 showed significant, but incomplete, colocalization at the plasma membrane. In addition, an endogenous association between GLUT1 and 4F2hc was demonstrated using mouse brain tissue and HeLa cells. Interestingly, overexpression of 4F2hc increased the amount of GLUT1 protein in HeLa and HepG2 cells with increased glucose uptake. In contrast, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated 4F2hc gene suppression markedly reduced GLUT1 protein in both cell types, with reduced glucose uptake. While GLUT1 mRNA levels were not affected by overexpression or gene silencing of 4F2hc, GLUT1 degradation after the addition of cycloheximide was significantly suppressed by 4F2hc overexpression and increased by 4F2hc siRNA treatment. Taken together, these observations indicate that 4F2hc is likely to be involved in GLUT1 stabilization and to contribute to the regulation of not only amino acid but also glucose metabolism.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7973129,Characterization and astrocytic modulation of system L transporters in brain microvasculature endothelial cells,"Brain trafficking of amino acids is mainly mediated by amino acids transport machineries of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), where astrocytes play a key maintenance role. However, little is known about astrocytes impacts on such transport systems, in particular system L that consists of large and small neutral amino acids (NAAs) transporters, that is, LAT1/4F2hc and LAT2/4F2hc, respectively. In the current investigation, functionality and expression of system L were studied in the immortalized mouse brain microvascular endothelial b.End3 cells cocultured with astrocytes or treated with astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM). LAT2/4F2hc mediated luminal uptake of L-phenylalanine and L-leucine resulted in significantly decreased affinity of system L in b.End3 cells treated with ACM, while LAT2/4F2hc mediated luminal uptake of L-alanine remained unchanged. Gene expression analysis revealed marked upregulation of LAT1 and 4F2hc, but downregulation of LAT2 in b.End3 cells cultured with ACM. The basal to apical transport of L-phenylalanine and L-alanine appeared to be significantly greater than that of the apical to basal direction in b.End3 cells indicating an efflux functionality of system L. No marked influence was observed for transport of L-phenylalanine in b.End3 cells cocultured with astrocytes, while a slight decrease was seen for L-alanine in the basal to apical direction. Based on our findings, we propose that system L functions as influx and/or efflux transport machinery displaying a greater propensity for the outward transport of large and small NAAs.

7973132,Thyroxine (T4) Transfer from Blood to Cerebrospinal Fluid in Sheep Isolated Perfused Choroid Plexus: Role of Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins and Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides,"Thyroxine (T4) enters the brain either directly across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or indirectly via the choroid plexus (CP), which forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (B-CSF-B). In this study, using isolated perfused CP of the sheep by single-circulation paired tracer and steady-state techniques, T4 transport mechanisms from blood into lateral ventricle CP has been characterized as the first step in the transfer across the B-CSF-B. After removal of sheep brain, the CPs were perfused with 125I-T4 and 14C-mannitol. Unlabeled T4 was applied during single tracer technique to assess the mode of maximum uptake (Umax) and the net uptake (Unet) on the blood side of the CP. On the other hand, in order to characterize T4 protein transporters, steady-state extraction of 125I-T4 was measured in presence of different inhibitors such as probenecid, verapamil, BCH, or indomethacin. Increasing the concentration of unlabeled-T4 resulted in a significant reduction in Umax%, which was reflected by a complete inhibition of T4 uptake into CP. In fact, the obtained Unet% decreased as the concentration of unlabeled-T4 increased. The addition of probenecid caused a significant inhibition of T4 transport, in comparison to control, reflecting the presence of a carrier mediated process at the basolateral side of the CP and the involvement of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs: MRP1 and MRP4) and organic anion transporting polypeptides (Oatp1, Oatp2, and Oatp14). Moreover, verapamil, the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, resulted in ~34% decrease in the net extraction of T4, indicating that MDR1 contributes to T4 entry into CSF. Finally, inhibition in the net extraction of T4 caused by BCH or indomethacin suggests, respectively, a role for amino acid ""L"" system and MRP1/Oatp1 in mediating T4 transfer. The presence of a carrier-mediated transport mechanism for cellular uptake on the basolateral membrane of the CP, mainly P-gp and Oatp2, would account for the efficient T4 transport from blood to CSF. The current study highlights a carrier-mediated transport mechanism for T4 movement from blood to brain at the basolateral side of B-CSF-B/CP, as an alternative route to BBB.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
7973148,The role of branched chain amino acid and tryptophan metabolism in rat's behavioral diversity: Intertwined peripheral and brain effects,"Previously, we showed that a transient early-in-life interference with the expression of multiple genes by mithramycin (MTR) followed by later-in-life exposure to chronic stress, leads to a ""daring"" and novelty seeking behavior in rats. In this study we searched for molecular changes that contribute to this behavioral alteration. We applied a non-hypothesis driven strategy using whole genome cDNA array analysis (WGA) followed by Genome Scale Metabolic modeling analysis (GSMM). Gene expression validation was performed by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Brain and serum amino acids levels were measured by HPLC. WGA data directed us towards metabolic pathways and GSMM pointed at branched chain amino acids (BCAA) pathway. Out of 21 amino acids analyzed in the prefrontal cortex of MTR+Stress rats only tryptophan, whose brain levels depend on serum BCAA levels, showed a significant decrease. No change was observed in serotonin or kynurenine levels. However, a significant reduction in mRNA and protein levels of the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1), which transports BCAA and tryptophan into the brain, as well as in serum levels of tryptophan/BCAA ratio were observed. The latter may be attributed to the failure to increase serum insulin, following stress, in rats pre-exposed to mithramycin. Finally, significant correlations were observed between the anxiety index and tryptophan and between T-maze errors and LAT1. This study shows a specific behavioral pattern, which is linked to modulations in fluxes of amino acids both peripheral and central, which converge and reciprocally interact, and may thus be equally important targets for therapeutic intervention.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973153,Transthyretin provides trophic support via megalin by promoting neurite outgrowth and neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia,"Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein whose function has been associated to binding and distribution of thyroid hormones in the body and brain. However, little is known regarding the downstream signaling pathways triggered by wild-type TTR in the CNS either in neuroprotection of cerebral ischemia or in physiological conditions. In this study, we investigated how TTR affects hippocampal neurons in physiologic/pathologic conditions. Recombinant TTR significantly boosted neurite outgrowth in mice hippocampal neurons, both in number and length, independently of its ligands. This TTR neuritogenic activity is mediated by the megalin receptor and is lost in megalin-deficient neurons. We also found that TTR activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (ERK1/2) and Akt through Src, leading to the phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB. In addition, TTR promoted a transient rise in intracellular calcium through NMDA receptors, in a Src/megalin-dependent manner. Moreover, under excitotoxic conditions, TTR stimulation rescued cell death and neurite loss in TTR KO hippocampal neurons, which are more sensitive to excitotoxic degeneration than WT neurons, in a megalin-dependent manner. CREB was also activated by TTR under excitotoxic conditions, contributing to changes in the balance between Bcl2 protein family members, toward anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl2/BclXL versus Bax). Finally, we clarify that TTR KO mice subjected to pMCAO have larger infarcts than WT mice, because of TTR and megalin neuronal downregulation. Our results indicate that TTR might be regarded as a neurotrophic factor, because it stimulates neurite outgrowth under physiological conditions, and promotes neuroprotection in ischemic conditions.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973154,Metallothionein-protein interactions,"Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of universal, small proteins, sharing a high cysteine content and an optimal capacity for metal ion coordination. They take part in a plethora of metal ion-related events (from detoxification to homeostasis, storage, and delivery), in a wide range of stress responses, and in different pathological processes (tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration, and inflammation). The information on both intracellular and extracellular interactions of MTs with other proteins is here comprehensively reviewed. In mammalian kidney, MT1/MT2 interact with megalin and related receptors, and with the transporter transthyretin. Most of the mammalian MT partners identified concern interactions with central nervous system (mainly brain) proteins, both through physical contact or metal exchange reactions. Physical interactions mainly involve neuronal secretion multimers. Regarding metal swap events, brain MT3 appears to control the metal ion load in peptides whose aggregation leads to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Aβ peptide, α-synuclein, and prion proteins (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and spongiform encephalopathies, respectively). Interaction with ferritin and bovine serum albumin are also documented. The intercourse of MTs with zinc-dependent enzymes and transcription factors is capable to activate/deactivate them, thus conferring MTs the role of metabolic and gene expression regulators. As some of these proteins are involved in cell cycle and proliferation control (p53, nuclear factor κB, and PKCμ), they are considered in the context of oncogenesis and tumor progression.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated delayed myelination in early childhood in both patients. Nevertheless, matured myelination was observed at 6 years of age in one patient. Although the key finding for AHDS is elevated free T3, one of the patients showed a normal T3 level in childhood, misleading the diagnosis of AHDS.

We analyzed the distribution of MCT8 and OATP1C1 in adult mouse SVZ. Both are strongly expressed in NSCs and at a lower level in neuronal cell precursors but not in oligodendrocyte progenitors. Next, we analyzed Mct8/Oatp1c1 double-knockout mice, where brain uptake of THs is strongly reduced.

TTR is abundant in cerebrospinal fluid, where it may be involved in transport of thyroid hormones into the brain. TTR derived amyloid is associated with diseases such as senile systemic amyloidosis, familial amyloid polyneuropathy and familial amyloid cardiomyopathy.

7973159,"Insights into the Structure, Function, and Ligand Discovery of the Large Neutral Amino Acid Transporter 1, LAT1","The large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1, or SLC7A5) is a sodium- and pH-independent transporter, which supplies essential amino acids (e.g., leucine, phenylalanine) to cells. It plays an important role at the Blood⁻Brain Barrier (BBB) where it facilitates the transport of thyroid hormones, pharmaceuticals (e.g., l-DOPA, gabapentin), and metabolites into the brain. Moreover, its expression is highly upregulated in various types of human cancer that are characterized by an intense demand for amino acids for growth and proliferation. Therefore, LAT1 is believed to be an important drug target for cancer treatment. With the crystallization of the arginine/agmatine antiporter (AdiC) from Escherichia Coli, numerous homology models of LAT1 have been built to elucidate the substrate binding site, ligand⁻transporter interaction, and structure⁻function relationship. The use of these models in combination with molecular docking and experimental testing has identified novel chemotypes of ligands of LAT1. Here, we highlight the structure, function, transport mechanism, and homology modeling of LAT1. Additionally, results from structure⁻function studies performed on LAT1 are addressed, which have enhanced our knowledge of the mechanism of substrate binding and translocation. This is followed by a discussion on ligand- and structure-based approaches, with an emphasis on elucidating the molecular basis of LAT1 inhibition.

To identify markers associated with neurological damage, we examined TTR expression in serum by Western blotting.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Gene expression profiling of brain tissue from a mouse model of PKU revealed overexpression of transthyretin (Ttr), sclerostin domain containing 1 (Sostdc1), alpha-Klotho (Kl), prolactin receptor (Prlr), and early growth response 2 (Egr2). In contrast to its overexpression in the brain, TTR expression was low in the sera of PKU mice offered unrestricted access to a diet containing phenylalanine. Expression of TTR decreased in a time-dependent manner in phenylalanine-treated HepG2 cells.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>These findings indicate that Ttr, Sostdc1, Kl, Prlr, and Egr2 can be involved in the pathogenesis of PKU and that phenylalanine might have a direct effect on the level of TTR in serum.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7973164,"Tissue-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases for expression of transthyretin by phenylalanine and its metabolite, phenylpyruvic acid","Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Transthyretin has been implicated as an indicator of nutritional status in phenylketonuria patients. In this study, we report that phenylalanine and its metabolite, phenylpyruvic acid, affect MAPK, changing transthyretin expression in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. Treatment of HepG2 cells with phenylalanine or phenylpyruvic acid decreased transcription of the TTR gene and decreased the transcriptional activity of the TTR promoter site, which was partly mediated through HNF4alpha. Decreased levels of p38 MAPK were detected in the liver of phenylketonuria-affected mice compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, treatment with phenylalanine increased transthyretin expression and induced ERK1/2 activation in PC-12 cells; ERK1/2 activation was also elevated in the brainstem of phenylketonuria-affected mice. These findings may explain between-tissue differences in gene expression, including Ttr gene expression, in the phenylketonuria mouse model.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973165,A new procedure for detecting brain-specific proteins in cerebrospinal fluid,"We have developed a new procedure, including three affinity chromatography steps, micro-reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (mR-HPLC) and Western blotting/mass spectrometric analysis to study central nervous system (CNS) specific proteins in human cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) in order to find biochemical markers for neuronal and synaptic function and pathology in degenerative brain disorders. After the three affinity chromatography steps, intended to remove interfering serum proteins from CSF, mR-HPLC revealed four major peaks, which by both Western blotting and mass spectrometric analyses were found to correspond to beta 2-microglobulin, cystatin C, transthyretin (TTR) and asialotransferrin. When comparing these peaks in CSF from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and age-matched healthy controls, a reduction of the brain-specific TTR was found. Therefore we quantified TTR in CSF and serum samples from 8 patients with early onset AD (EAD), 18 patients with late onset AD (LAD), 8 patients with vascular dementia (VAD) and 18 healthy individuals using a nephelometric method. CSF-TTR was divided into barrier-dependent and barrier-independent TTR. The barrier-independent i.e. brain-specific TTR was significantly reduced in the EAD group compared to the controls. Transthyretin has been found to be present in the senile plaques in AD, and to specifically bind to beta/A4 protein, the major component of the amyloid deposits in AD. Therefore, the reduction of the transthyretin-isoform in CSF in AD may reflect an absorption of transthyretin to the amyloid deposits in the senile plaques.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973166,The pituitary control of rat thyroxine binding globulin,"Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is in the rat a developmentally regulated protein, actively synthesized in postnatal developing pups and in aging animals, but undetectable in adults. Experimental depletion of thyroid hormones (TH) in adults by thyroidectomy (Tx) or by hypophysectomy (Hx) results in marked reexpression of TBG synthesis. T3 replacement in both cases antagonizes this effect, though only moderately in Hx rats. These observations point to a regulatory pathway of TBG synthesis common to TX and Hx rats, characterized by an inverse relationship between TBG and TH levels. However, along with this thyroid-dependent TBG regulation, important differences between Tx and Hx rats are evidenced, pointing to specific pituitary factors of TBG control. The most striking difference concerns the effect of growth hormone (GH) replacement: the TBG of Tx rats is not affected, in contrast to that of Hx rats which is further increased by GH administration. The TBG response of the GH-treated Hx rats, which is strongly resistant to inhibition by T3, might involve deshomeostasis of GH-controlled functions not necessarily linked to the thyroid, e.g. the pancreatic functions regulating carbohydrate or lipid metabolism. In the light of these studies, it may be envisaged that the high surge of rat TBG during postnatal development involves a transient sensitivity of the TBG gene to stimulation by endogenous GH, and that this sensitivity lasts until functional maturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis has been achieved.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973167,Thyroid hormone deiodinases response in brain of spontaneausly hypertensive rats after hypotensive effects induced by mandibular extension,"<strong>PURPOSE: </strong>The deiodinases activate or inactivate the thyroid hormones (TH) in virtually all tissues in both physiological and pathological conditions. The three deiodinases, DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3, have different catalytic functions and regulate TH tissue distribution. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the modulation of gene expression of the deiodinases and TH transporters and protein levels of DIO1 in parietal and frontal areas of cerebral cortex of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), after two successive mandibular extensions (ME).<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>ME was performed on anesthetized rats by a dilatator appropriately designed and real-time PCR and western blotting techniques were employed for gene expression and protein level study.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Mean blood pressure (MBP) significantly decreased in 2ME-treated rats when compared to sham-operated rats (p < 0.001) and this decrease lasted for the entire observation period. In gene expression analysis, in 2ME-treated rats we did not observe any significant variation of DIO1 and DIO3 with respect to the sham-operated rats. Differently, DIO2 gene expression significantly increased in frontal area of 2ME-treated rats, with respect to sham-operated rats (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in parietal area, protein levels of DIO1 in 2ME-treated rats were significantly higher than in sham-operated rats (p < 0.01). Moreover MCT8 and OATP1C1 both resulted significantly higher (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001) in sham frontal cortex.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>In summary, our data on SHRs, while confirming the hypotensive effect of two MEs, show that the treatment also solicits the three deiodinases production in the cerebral cortex.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7973170,Erythropoietin in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage originates from the brain,"Recent years' research has revealed a specific, neuroprotective erythropoietin (EPO) system in the central nervous system (CNS) that is upregulated by hypoxia. The presence and dynamics of EPO in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) has not been investigated. We collected a total of 83 corresponding serum and CSF samples from 18 patients with aneurysmal SAH and compared the concentrations of EPO with those of blood-derived markers of blood-brain barrier function (albumin, transferrin, alpha(2)-macroglobulin) and with those of proteins with well-known CNS synthesis (prealbumin, apolipoprotein E). The EPO concentration in CSF was 0.93 (0.82) mU/ml (median and inter-quartile range). Nine patients presented CSF-EPO values above 1 mU/ml. CSF levels did not correlate with serum concentrations and were independent of blood-brain barrier integrity suggesting a synthesis in CNS rather than a blood-derived origin. Furthermore, the median CSF:serum ratio (Q(protein)) of EPO was similar to those of prealbumin and apolipoprotein E, and much higher than those of albumin, transferrin and alpha(2)-macroglobulin. When the Q(protein) of all proteins were plotted against Q(albumin), EPO showed dynamics similar to CNS-derived proteins.

7973173,Immunocytochemical localization of corticosteroid-binding globulin in rat tissues,"Previous studies utilizing steroid-binding assays have suggested that corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)-like glucocorticoid binding sites are present in various tissues of the rat. It is not known, however, whether such binding reflects the intracellular presence of CBG derived from serum or a special class (type III) of receptors. In order to elucidate this problem, immunocytochemical localization of rat CBG was carried out using a specific antiserum prepared against rat serum CBG and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. Positive staining was found in certain cells of the liver, the distal and/or convoluted tubules of the kidney, the uterus, the follicular cells of the thyroid, and some cells of the anterior pituitary. Other tissues including heart, muscle, thymus, hypothalamus, supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and diaphragm were negative.

7973174,Genetic and Functional Study of L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 in Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia involves neural catecholaminergic dysregulation. Tyrosine is the precursor of catecholamines, and its major transporter, according to studies on fibroblasts, in the brain is the L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). The present study assessed haplotype tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the SLC7A5/LAT1 gene in 315 patients with psychosis within the schizophrenia spectrum and 233 healthy controls to investigate genetic vulnerability to the disorder as well as genetic relationships to homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), the major catecholamine metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Moreover, the involvement of the different isoforms of the system L in tyrosine uptake and LAT1 tyrosine kinetics were studied in fibroblast cell lines of 10 patients with schizophrenia and 10 healthy controls. The results provide suggestive evidence of individual vulnerability to schizophrenia related to the LAT1 SNP rs9936204 genotype. A number of SNPs were nominally associated with CSF HVA and MHPG concentrations but did not survive correction for multiple testing. The LAT1 isoform was confirmed as the major tyrosine transporter in patients with schizophrenia. However, the kinetic parameters (maximal transport capacity, affinity of the binding sites, and diffusion constant of tyrosine transport through the LAT1 isoform) did not differ between patients with schizophrenia and controls. The present genetic findings call for independent replication in larger samples, while the functional study seems to exclude a role of LAT1 in the aberrant transport of tyrosine in fibroblasts of patients with schizophrenia.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7973175,Altered choroid plexus gene expression in major depressive disorder,"Given the emergent interest in biomarkers for mood disorders, we assessed gene expression in the choroid plexus (CP), the region that produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Genes that are expressed in the CP can be secreted into the CSF and may be potential biomarker candidates. Given that we have previously shown that fibroblast growth factor family members are differentially expressed in post-mortem brain of subjects with MDD and the CP is a known source of growth factors in the brain, we posed the question whether growth factor dysregulation would be found in the CP of subjects with MDD. We performed laser capture microscopy of the CP at the level of the hippocampus in subjects with MDD and psychiatrically normal controls. We then extracted, amplified, labeled, and hybridized the cRNA to Illumina BeadChips to assess gene expression. In controls, the most highly abundant known transcript was transthyretin. Moreover, half of the 14 most highly expressed transcripts in controls encode ribosomal proteins. Using BeadStudio software, we identified 169 transcripts differentially expressed (p < 0.05) between control and MDD samples. Using pathway analysis we noted that the top network altered in subjects with MDD included multiple members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) pathway. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed downregulation of several transcripts that interact with the extracellular matrix in subjects with MDD. These results suggest that there may be an altered cytoskeleton in the CP in MDD subjects that may lead to a disrupted blood-CSF-brain barrier.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7973177,Chemistry and Biology in the Biosynthesis and Action of Thyroid Hormones,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are secreted by the thyroid gland. They control lipid, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism, heart rate, neural development, as well as cardiovascular, renal, and brain functions. The thyroid gland mainly produces l-thyroxine (T4) as a prohormone, and 5'-deiodination of T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases generates the nuclear receptor binding hormone T3. In this Review, we discuss the basic aspects of the chemistry and biology as well as recent advances in the biosynthesis of THs in the thyroid gland, plasma transport, and internalization of THs in their target organs, in addition to the deiodination and various other enzyme-mediated metabolic pathways of THs.

7642265,Thyroid hormone transport and metabolism by organic anion transporter 1C1 and consequences of genetic variation,"Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1C1 has been characterized as a specific thyroid hormone transporter. Based on its expression in capillaries in different brain regions, OATP1C1 is thought to play a key role in transporting thyroid hormone across the blood-brain barrier. For this reason, we studied the specificity of iodothyronine transport by OATP1C1 in detail by analysis of thyroid hormone uptake in OATP1C1-transfected COS1 cells. Furthermore, we examined whether OATP1C1 is rate limiting in subsequent thyroid hormone metabolism in cells cotransfected with deiodinases. We also studied the effect of genetic variation in the OATP1C1 gene: polymorphisms were determined in 155 blood donors and 1192 Danish twins and related to serum thyroid hormone levels. In vitro effects of the polymorphisms were analyzed in cells transfected with the variants. Cells transfected with OATP1C1 showed increased transport of T4 and T4 sulfate (T4S), little transport of rT3, and no transport of T3 or T3 sulphate, compared with mock transfected cells. Metabolism of T4, T4S, and rT3 by cotransfected deiodinases was greatly augmented in the presence of OATP1C1. The OATP1C1-intron3C>T, Pro143Thr, and C3035T polymorphisms were not consistently associated with thyroid hormone levels, nor did they affect transport function in vitro. In conclusion, OATP1C1 mediates transport of T4, T4S, and rT3 and increases the access of these substrates to the intracellular active sites of the deiodinases. No effect of genetic variation on the function of OATP1C1 was observed.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642264,Tetrac can replace thyroid hormone during brain development in mouse mutants deficient in the thyroid hormone transporter mct8,"The monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) plays a critical role in mediating the uptake of thyroid hormones (THs) into the brain. In patients, inactivating mutations in the MCT8 gene are associated with a severe form of psychomotor retardation and abnormal serum TH levels. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of the TH analog 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) as a replacement for T(4) in brain development. Using COS1 cells transfected with TH transporter and deiodinase constructs, we could show that tetrac, albeit not being transported by MCT8, can be metabolized to the TH receptor active compound 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (triac) by type 2 deiodinase and inactivated by type 3 deiodinase. Triac in turn is capable of replacing T(3) in primary murine cerebellar cultures where it potently stimulates Purkinje cell development. In vivo effects of tetrac were assessed in congenital hypothyroid Pax8-knockout (KO) and Mct8/Pax8 double-KO mice as well as in Mct8-KO and wild-type animals after daily injection of tetrac (400 ng/g body weight) during the first postnatal weeks. This treatment was sufficient to promote TH-dependent neuronal differentiation in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum but was ineffective in suppressing hypothalamic TRH expression. In contrast, TSH transcript levels in the pituitary were strongly down-regulated in response to tetrac. Based on our findings we propose that tetrac administration offers the opportunity to provide neurons during the postnatal stage with a potent TH receptor agonist, thereby eventually reducing the neurological damage in patients with MCT8 mutations without deteriorating the thyrotoxic situation in peripheral tissues.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642261,Animal models to study thyroid hormone action in cerebellum,"Thyroid hormone plays a crucial role in the development and functional maintenance of the central nervous system including the cerebellum. To study the molecular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action, various animal models have been used. These are classified: (1) congenital hypothyroid animals due to thyroid gland dysgenesis or thyroid dyshormonogenesis, (2) thyroid hormone receptor (TR) gene-mutated animals, and (3) thyroid hormone transport or metabolism-modified animals. TR is a ligand-activated transcription factor. In the presence of ligand, it activates transcription of target gene, whereas it represses the transcription without ligand. Thus, phenotype of TR-knockout mouse is different from that of hypothyroid animal (low thyroid hormone level), in which unliganded TR actively represses the transcription. On the other hand, human patient harboring mutant TR expresses different phenotypes depending on the function of mutated TR. To mimic this phenotype, other animal models are generated. In addition, recent human studies have shown that thyroid hormone transporters such as monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 8 may play an important role in thyroid hormone-mediated brain development. However, MCT8 knockout mouse show different phenotypes from a human patient.

Unless accompanied by an increase in health span, increases in age-related diseases will increase the burden on health care resources. Intervention studies to enhance healthy ageing need appropriate outcome measures, such as blood-borne biomarkers, which are easily obtainable, cost-effective, and widely accepted. To date there have been no systematic reviews of blood-borne biomarkers of mortality.<br /><br /><strong>AIM: </strong>To conduct a systematic review to identify available blood-borne biomarkers of mortality that can be used to predict healthy ageing post-retirement.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Four databases (Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched. We included prospective cohort studies with a minimum of two years follow up and data available for participants with a mean age of 50 to 75 years at baseline.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>From a total of 11,555 studies identified in initial searches, 23 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Fifty-one blood borne biomarkers potentially predictive of mortality risk were identified. In total, 20 biomarkers were associated with mortality risk. Meta-analyses of mortality risk showed significant associations with C-reactive protein (Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality 1.42, p<0.001; Cancer-mortality 1.62, p<0.009; CVD-mortality 1.31, p = 0.033), N Terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality 1.43, p<0.001; CHD-mortality 1.58, p<0.001; CVD-mortality 1.67, p<0.001) and white blood cell count (Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality 1.36, p = 0.001). There was also evidence that brain natriuretic peptide, cholesterol fractions, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, granulocytes, homocysteine, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, neutrophils, osteoprotegerin, procollagen type III aminoterminal peptide, serum uric acid, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and tumour necrosis factor receptor II may predict mortality risk. There was equivocal evidence for the utility of 14 biomarkers and no association with mortality risk for CD40 ligand, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, ferritin, haemoglobin, interleukin-12, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, myelopereoxidase, P-selectin, receptor activator of nuclear factor KappaB ligand, sex hormone binding globulin, testosterone, transferrin, and thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroxine.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Twenty biomarkers should be prioritised as potential predictors of mortality in future studies.

7641190,"Transthyretin stabilization by iododiflunisal promotes amyloid-β peptide clearance, decreases its deposition, and ameliorates cognitive deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and now represents 50-70% of total dementia cases. Over the last two decades, transthyretin (TTR) has been associated with AD and, very recently, a novel concept of TTR stability has been established in vitro as a key factor in TTR/amyloid-β (Aβ) interaction. Small compounds, TTR stabilizers (usually non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs), bind to the thyroxine (T4) central binding channel, increasing TTR tetrameric stability and TTR/Aβ interaction. In this work, we evaluated in vivo the effects of one of the TTR stabilizers identified as improving TTR/Aβ interaction, iododiflunisal (IDIF), in Aβ deposition and other AD features, using AβPPswe/PS1A246E transgenic mice, either carrying two or just one copy of the TTR gene (AD/TTR+/+ or AD/TTR+/-, respectively), available and characterized in our laboratory. The results showed that IDIF administered orally bound TTR in plasma and stabilized the protein, as assessed by T4 displacement assays, and was able to enter the brain as revealed by mass spectrometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. TTR levels, both in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, were not altered. In AD/TTR+/- mice, IDIF administration resulted not only in decreased brain Aβ levels and deposition but also in improved cognitive function associated with the AD-like neuropathology in this mouse model, although no improvements were detectable in the AD/TTR+/+ animals. Further, in AD/TTR+/- mice, Aβ levels were reduced in plasma suggesting TTR promoted Aβ clearance from the brain and from the periphery. Taken together, these results strengthen the importance of TTR stability in the design of therapeutic drugs, highlighting the capacity of IDIF to be used in AD treatment to prevent and to slow the progression of the disease.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Choroid plexus epithelial cells expressed transthyretin at high levels in developing rat cerebral hemispheres and in cultured cells. These cells secreted transthyretin into the cerebrospinal fluid. In the developing rat brain transthyretin was present in the cytoplasm of ependymal cells, in vesicles in contact with the apical membrane and in cilia. In ependymal cell cultures this protein was particularly abundant in the cilia of these cells. In contrast, ependymal cells did not synthesize transthyretin.

We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry to screen differentially expressed proteins in the brain cells of rats under chronic clozapine treatment. We identified a protein, transthyretin, which was significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus of rats after four weeks' treatment of clozapine (20mg/kg) as compared with control animals. Western blot analysis further supported this finding. Besides, we also observed increased transcription of transthyretin mRNA in the cerebral cortex of rats under chronic treatment of clozapine (20mg/kg) or olanzapine (2mg/kg), but not haloperidol (1mg/kg), using real-time quantitative PCR. Transthyretin is a retinol carrier protein, our findings suggest that antipsychotic drugs treatment may affect the retinoid signaling cascade in the brain. Besides, transthyretin is also an indicator of nutritional status; increased transthyretin may be associated with the body weight gain of taking atypical antipsychotic drugs.

Levels of estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were similar in all stroke groups.

7641932,Cell and molecular biology of transthyretin and thyroid hormones,"Advances in four areas of transthyretin (TTR) research result in this being a timely review. Developmental studies have revealed that TTR is synthesized in all classes of vertebrates during development. This leads to a new hypothesis on selection pressure for hepatic TTR synthesis during development only, changing the previous hypotheses from ""onset"" of hepatic TTR synthesis in adulthood to ""maintaining"" hepatic TTR synthesis into adulthood. Evolutionary studies have revealed the existence of TTR-like proteins (TLPs) in nonvertebrate species and elucidated some of their functions. Consequently, TTR is an excellent model for the study of the evolution of protein structure, function, and localization. Studies of human diseases have demonstrated that TTR in the cerebrospinal fluid can form amyloid, but more recently there has been recognition of the roles of TTR in depression and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, amyloid mutations in human TTR that are the normal residues in other species result in cardiac deposition of TTR amyloid in humans. Finally, a revised model for TTR-thyroxine entry into the cerebrospinal fluid via the choroid plexus, based on data from studies in TTR null mice, is presented. This review concentrates on TTR and its thyroid hormone binding, in development and during evolution, and summarizes what is currently known about TLPs and the role of TTR in diseases affecting the brain.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7641933,Role of transthyretin in thyroxine transfer from cerebrospinal fluid to brain and choroid plexus,"The transport of 125I-labeled thyroxine (T4) from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into brain and choroid plexus (CP) was measured in anesthetized rabbit [0.5 mg/kg medetomidine (Domitor) and 10 mg/kg pentobarbitonal sodium (Sagatal) iv] using the ventriculocisternal (V-C) perfusion technique. 125I-labeled T4 contained in artificial CSF was continually perfused into the lateral ventricles for up to 4 h and recovered from the cisterna magna. The %recovery of 125I-labeled T4 from the aCSF was 47.2+/-5.6% (n=10), indicating removal of 125I-labeled T4 from the CSF. The recovery increased to 53.2+/-6.3% (n=4) and 57.8+/-14.8% (n=3), in the presence of 100 and 200 microM unlabeled-T4, respectively (P<0.05), indicating a saturable component to T4 removal from CSF. There was a large accumulation of 125I-labeled T4 in the CP, and this was reduced by 80% in the presence of 200 microM unlabeled T4, showing saturation. In the presence of the thyroid-binding protein transthyretin (TTR), more 125I-labeled T4 was recovered from CSF, indicating that the binding protein acted to retain T4 in CSF. However, 125I-labeled T4 uptake into the ependymal region (ER) of the frontal cortex also increased by 13 times compared with control conditions. Elevation was also seen in the hippocampus (HC) and brain stem. Uptake was significantly inhibited by the presence of endocytosis inhibitors nocodazole and monensin by >50%. These data suggest that the distribution of T4 from CSF into brain and CP is carrier mediated, TTR dependent, and via RME. These results support a role for TTR in the distribution of T4 from CSF into brain sites around the ventricular system, indicating those areas involved in neurogenesis (ER and HC).",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

On admission, the condition of 47 (79.7%) was rated as grades III-VI according to the Hunt-Hess scale, which was responsible for high mortality rates (33.89% in the assessment of outcomes according to the Glasgow outcome scale). The causes of death were ischemic and hemorrhagic insults, edema of the brain, cerebral stem wedging. Laboratory findings were analyzed in relation to the clinical condition of patients, outcomes, and the degree of secondary vasospasm assessed by Doppler transcranial study by the average blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. They revealed a significant depression of thyroidal metabolism with developed the total low T3 syndrome just before surgical treatment in patients with deterioration in the early postoperative period. The significant correlations found by the authors between the decreased blood T3 and TSH levels and 1) the severity of neurological disorders; 2) the degree of vasospasm, and 3) the outcome of disease, as well as negative correlations of elevated TNF-alpha levels not only in the blood, but also in CSF with the content of CT3, CT4 and with the severity of neurological symptomatology are indicative of the development of isolated syndrome in the brain, which is characterized by specific thyroidal metabolic disorders, which the author propose to call the cerebral low T3 syndrome (by taking into account the presence of the autonomic systems of thyroidal homeostatic provision).",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Although he presented with polyneuropathy accompanied by autonomic dysfunction and vitreous opacities in both eyes, he has shown no overt signs or symptoms of CNS involvement. Total protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid was moderately elevated. In the gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRIs of the brain and spinal cord, leptomeningeal enhancement was seen along the surfaces of the brain stem and more clearly in the spinal cord, suggesting leptomeningeal TTR-related amyloid deposition. Our result indicates that gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the CNS may be a very sensitive and useful method for detecting leptomeningeal amyloid deposition, since abnormal findings can be detected even at a presymptomatic stage of CNS involvement.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7641936,Proteomic comparison of human and great ape blood plasma reveals conserved glycosylation and differences in thyroid hormone metabolism,"Most blood plasma proteins are glycosylated. These glycoproteins typically carry sialic acid-bearing sugar chains, which can modify the observed molecular weights and isoelectric points of those proteins during electrophoretic analyses. To explore changes in protein expression and glycosylation that occurred during great ape and human evolution, we subjected multiple blood plasma samples from all these species to high-resolution proteomic analysis. We found very few species-specific differences, indicating a remarkable degree of conservation of plasma protein expression and glycosylation during approximately 12 million years of evolution. A few lineage-specific differences in protein migration were noted among the great apes. The only obvious differences between humans and all great apes were an apparent decrease in transthyretin (prealbumin) and a change in haptoglobin isoforms (the latter was predictable from prior genetic studies). Quantitative studies of transthyretin in samples of blood plasma (synthesized primarily by the liver) and of cerebrospinal fluid (synthesized locally by the choroid plexus of the brain) confirmed approximately 2-fold higher levels in chimpanzees compared to humans. Since transthyretin binds thyroid hormones, we next compared plasma thyroid hormone parameters between humans and chimpanzees. The results indicate significant differences in the status of thyroid hormone metabolism, which represent the first known endocrine difference between these species. Notably, thyroid hormones are known to play major roles in the development, differentiation, and metabolism of many organs and tissues, including the brain and the cranium. Also, transthyretin is known to be the major carrier of thyroid hormone in the cerebrospinal fluid, likely regulating delivery of this hormone to the brain. A potential secondary difference in retinoid (vitamin A) metabolism is also noted. The implications of these findings for explaining unique features of human evolution are discussed.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
7641940,"The evolution of gene expression, structure and function of transthyretin","Thyroxine, the most abundant thyroid hormone in blood, partitions into lipid membranes. In a network-like system, thyroxine-binding plasma proteins counteract this partitioning and establish intravascular, protein-bound thyroxine pools. These are far larger than the free thyroxine pools. In larger eutherians, proteins specifically binding thyroxine are albumin, transthyretin, and thyroxine-binding globulin. Some binding of thyroxine can also occur to lipoproteins. During evolution, transthyretin synthesis first appeared in the choroid plexus of the stem reptiles, about 300 million years ago. Transthretin synthesis in the liver evolved much later, independently, in birds, eutherians and some marsupial species. Analysis of 57 human transthyretin variants suggests that most mutations in transthyretin are not compatible with its normal metabolism and lead to its deposition as amyloid. Analysis of transthyretin or its gene in 20 different species shows that evolutionary changes of transthyretin predominantly occurred near the N-termini. A change in RNA splicing between exon 1 and exon 2 led to a decrease in hydrophobicity and length of the N-termini. It is proposed that the selection pressure producing these changes was the need for a more effective prevention of thyroxine partitioning into lipids. Lipid pools increased during evolution with the increases in relative sizes of brains and internal organs and changes in lipid composition of membranes in ectothermic and endothermic species.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
7641941,Thyroxine transport in choroid plexus,"The role of the choroid plexus in thyroid hormone transport between body and brain, suggested by strong synthesis and secretion of transthyretin in this tissue, was investigated in in vitro and in vivo systems. Rat choroid plexus pieces incubated in vitro were found to accumulate thyroid hormones from surrounding medium in a non-saturable process. At equilibrium, the ratio of thyroid hormone concentration in choroid plexus pieces to that in medium decreased upon increasing the concentration of transthyretin in the medium. Fluorescence quenching of fluorophores located at different depths in liposome membranes showed maximal hormone accumulation in the middle of the phospholipid bilayer. Partition coefficients of thyroxine and triiodothyronine between lipid and aqueous phase were about 20,000. After intravenous injection of 125I-labeled thyroid hormones, choroid plexus and parts of the brain steadily accumulated 125I-thyroxine, but not [125I]triiodothyronine, for many hours. The accumulation of 125I-thyroxine in choroid plexus preceded that in brain. The amount of 125I-thyroxine in non-brain tissues and the [125I]triiodothyronine content of all tissues decreased steadily beginning immediately after injection. A model is proposed for thyroxine transport from the bloodstream into cerebrospinal fluid based on partitioning of thyroxine between choroid plexus and surrounding fluids and binding of thyroxine to transthyretin newly synthesized and secreted by choroid plexus.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7641944,Central transthyretin acts to decrease food intake and body weight,"Transthyretin (TTR) is a blood and cerebrospinal fluid transporter of thyroxine and retinol. Gene expression profiling revealed an elevation of Ttr expression in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) of rats with exercise-induced anorexia, implying that central TTR may also play a functional role in modulating food intake and energy balance. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the effects of brain TTR on food intake and body weight and have further determined hypothalamic signaling that may underlie its feeding effect in rats. We found that intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of TTR in normal growing rats decreased food intake and body weight. This effect was not due to sickness as icv TTR did not cause a conditioned taste aversion. ICV TTR decreased neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels in the DMH and the paraventricular nucleus (P < 0.05). Chronic icv infusion of TTR in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats reversed hyperphagia and obesity and reduced DMH NPY levels. Overall, these results demonstrate a previously unknown anorectic action of central TTR in the control of energy balance, providing a potential novel target for treating obesity and its comorbidities.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7641948,[Involvement of thyroid hormones in mental recovery following severe craniocerebral trauma],"To study a role of thyroid hormones in the recovery of mental performance, 71 patients (60 males, 11 females) aged 7 to 66 years (mean age 32.7 +/- 3.5) with severe brain injury (TBI). According to the stage of mental recovery (1--none; 2--elementary acts; 3--verbal contact; 4--spatial orientation; 5--intellectual and mnestic processes and emotional and personality traits), the study was divided into 5 series. Immunoradiometric assay of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and their free fractions (FT3 and FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), and prolactin (P) revealed significant alterations in thyroid metabolism at stages 1 to 4, which appeared as low T3 syndrome. The thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) test made in study series 3 to 5 suggests that the patients have neuroendocrine dysfunctions at the mentioned recovery stages of mental functions of the brain. There was a close relationship of clinical parameters (mental time course) to alterations in the thyroid status and metabolism and to morphological impairments of brain tissues in their traumatic damage, which is evidenced by a correlation of the levels of blood and spinal fluid markers (neurone-specific enolase--NSE and protein S-100) of brain injury with psychopathological disorders (r = -0.96 and -0.6, respectively; p < 0.05) and by the assessment of TBI outcomes (r = -0.65 and -0.62, respectively; p < 0.05). Thus, the findings clinically confirm the neurotransmitter role of thyroid hormones at the stages of mental recovery. In addition, the results show that measurement of blood T3, FT3, TSH, T4, TBH, and NSE should be included into neurochemical monitoring in SBI as prognostically significant criteria.

7641986,"The trace components--selenium and flavonoids--affect iodothyronine deiodinases, thyroid hormone transport and TSH regulation","The trace elements iodine and selenium exert major control function on thyroid hormone homeostasis. Appropriate production, transport to target cells, activation of prohormones to yield receptor ligands, and metabolism resulting in the termination of the hormonal signals are influenced by these two trace elements but also by dietary compounds such as flavonoids. Flavonoids, ubiquitous secondary metabolites of plants and their synthetic derivatives such as EMD 21388 interfere with hormone binding to transthyretin and activation by the selenoenzyme Type I 5'deiodinase. The resulting alterations of free thyroid hormone fractions in serum effect pituitary feedback regulation, hormone action and elimination. Selenium dependent regulation of expression of Type I 5'deiodinase and glutathione peroxidase was studied in the porcine kidney epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 at the enzyme activity, protein and steady-state mRNA levels. A cellular hierarchy of selenite utilization with preferential incorporation into Type I 5'deiodinase compared to glutathione peroxidase was found under limiting selenite supply.

7641989,Expression of neuropeptide processing enzymes and neurosecretory proteins in ependyma and choroid plexus epithelium,"Recent studies suggest that brain ependyma and choroid plexus produce neuropeptide processing enzymes. To facilitate the understanding of these cells and their ability to produce biologically active peptides, we developed cultures of defined cell type. Ependymal cells were characterized by morphological criteria, and choroid plexus epithelial cell lines were characterized by the presence of the mRNA for IGF-II and transthyretin, a thyroxine binding protein produced in liver and choroid plexus. The ependymal cells and the choroid plexus epithelial cell lines were then examined for the presence of mRNAs for various neuropeptide processing enzymes. Northern blot analysis revealed high levels of furin, carboxypeptidase E, and peptidyl glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase mRNAs, with levels in ependymal cells comparable to those in brain or pituitary. Carboxypeptidase E activity was detected in medium from cultured ependymal cells; this activity was identified as carboxypeptidase E based on the acidic pH optimum and sensitivity to various inhibitors. The mRNAs for other neuropeptide processing enzymes, such as prohormone convertases 1 and 2, were not detected on Northern blots of RNA from ependyma or choroid plexus epithelium. Since ependyma and choroid plexus epithelium express a subset of processing enzymes, we suggest that these cells have the capacity to produce biologically active peptides.

7641990,Changes in the expression of transthyretin and protein kinase Cγ genes in the prefrontal cortex in response to naltrexone,"Naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of alcohol dependence. In the present study, we examined the underlying mechanisms of naltrexone by investigating the pharmacogenomic variations in the brain regions associated with alcohol consumption. A complementary DNA microarray analysis was used to profile gene expression changes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of C57BL/6 mice injected with naltrexone following ethanol treatment. Intraperitoneal administration of 200μl (16mg/kg) of naltrexone for 4 weeks caused alterations in the expression of a wide range of hippocampal (394) and PFC (566) genes in ethanol-treated mice. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to search for biological pathways and interrelationships between gene networks in the subsets of candidate genes that were altered in the naltrexone-treated PFC and hippocampus. We found gene networks associated with cell morphology, cell death, nervous system development and function, and neurological disease. Confirmation studies using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that the expression of transthyretin (TTR) and protein kinase C (PKC)γ were increased in the PFC but not in the hippocampus of naltrexone-treated mice. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates a pharmacogenomic response to naltrexone in the brains of ethanol-consuming mice.

7641991,Disturbance of rapid eye movement sleep in senescence-accelerated mouse prone/8 mice is improved by retinoic acid receptor agonist Am80 (Tamibarotene),"Senescence-accelerated mouse prone/8 (SAMP8) mice are known to exhibit age-related deterioration in sleep-wake architecture compared with senescence-accelerated mouse resistant/1 (SAMR1) mice. We investigated whether treatment with Am80 (Tamibarotene), a retinoic acid receptor agonist, would improve sleep in 9-10-month-old SAMP8 mice. One week of Am80 administration improved the decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep shown by SAMP8 mice. Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated an impairment in the hippocampal retinoid cascade (retinoic acid receptor alpha and transthyretin) in SAMP8 in comparison to SAMR1 mice. Am80 treatment induced an increase in mRNA expression in the vesicular acetylcholine transporter in the brainstem and transthyretin in the hippocampus. Furthermore, decreased cortical acetylcholine content in SAMP8 was improved by Am80 administration. Decreased non-REM sleep and delta oscillation were also observed in SAMP8 mice; however, this was not improved by Am80 administration. These results partially support the hypothesis that the effects of aging on sleep-wake architecture are improved by the activation of retinoic acid receptors.

7641992,Independent changes of thyroid hormones in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid after melatonin treatment in ewes,"The authors measured the effects of exogenous melatonin treatment on the concentrations of total (T) and free (f) fractions of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma as well as the expression of their binding/transporter protein, transthyretin (TTR), in the choroid plexus of ewes from May to August. Melatonin implantation in May and July mainly prevented the decrease in plasma for fT3 and TT3 exhibited in untreated group, and induced a limited decrease in TT4 in June. By contrast, melatonin implantation prevented the decrease in CSF fT3 observed in the untreated group. No effect of melatonin was found on the expression of TTR mRNA in the choroid plexus There were a correlations between blood fT4 and CSF TT4 concentrations in both control and melatonin treated group (r(2)-0.4; P < 0.01 vs. r(2)-0.14; P < 0.05), as well as between blood fT3 and CSF TT3 concentrations but only in the melatonin-treated group (r(2)-0.26; P < 0.02). We conclude that T3, the active form of the hormone within the brain, is regulated by melatonin independently of the peripheral changes within the blood. The lack of correlation between plasma fT3 and CSF TT3 in the control group suggests that an increase in local T3 conversion could contribute as an additional source of T3 in the CSF during the period of increasing day length.

The timing of this resurgent focus on receptors activated by the ""trace amines"" (TA) beta-phenylethylamine (PEA), tyramine (TYR), octopamine (OCT), synephrine (SYN), and tryptamine (TRYP) is the direct result of 2 publications that appeared in 2001 describing the cloning of a novel G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) referred to by their discoverers Borowsky et al. as TA1 and Bunzow et al. as TA receptor 1 (TAR1). When heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and various eukaryotic cell lines, recombinant rodent and human TAR dose-dependently couple to the stimulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) production. Structure-activity profiling based on this functional response has revealed that in addition to the TA, other biologically active compounds containing a 2-carbon aliphatic side chain linking an amino group to at least 1 benzene ring are potent and efficacious TA receptor agonists with amphetamine (AMPH), methamphetamine, 3-iodothyronamine, thyronamine, and dopamine (DA) among the most notable. Almost 100 years after the search for TAR began, numerous TA1/TAR1-related sequences, now called TA-associated receptors (TAAR), have been identified in the genome of every species of vertebrate examined to date. Consequently, even though heterologously expressed TAAR1 fits the pharmacological criteria established for a bona fide TAR, a major challenge for those working in the field is to discern the in vivo pharmacology and physiology of each purported member of this extended family of GPCR.

Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed a signal peptide-like sequence preceding a section coding for a full length subunit and an untranslated sequence at the 3' end. The deduced primary structure of rat transthyretin was compared with that of human transthyretin. It was highly conserved at the binding sites for thyroxine and the interfaces and core regions of the subunits. The cDNA for transthyretin was used to measure mRNA levels by hybridization. During acute inflammation, the amount of transthyretin mRNA in liver decreased (reaching a minimum of 25% of the normal level 36 h after inducing inflammation), suggesting regulation of transthyretin synthesis at the mRNA level. Transthyretin mRNA was found only in the liver and in the choroid plexus, but not in other parts of the central nervous system nor in the adrenal glands, kidney, spleen, testes, heart, lung, intestine, and ovaries. One gram of choroid plexus contained about 25 times larger amounts of transthyretin mRNA than 1 g of liver.

755712,Effect of hypothyroxinemia on thyroid hormone responsiveness and action during rat postnatal neocortical development,"Neurological deficits due to maternal and neonatal hypothyroxinemia under mild-moderate iodine deficiency are a major preventable health problem worldwide. The present study assesses the impact of hypothyroxinemia on postnatal neocortical development and also compares it to the known effects of severe hypothyroidism. Our results strongly suggest that even within elevated circulating triiodothyronine (T3) levels, hypothyroxinemia significantly impairs thyroid hormone responsiveness in developing rat neocortex. The significant compensatory alteration in deiodinase levels with unaltered monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), although found to be similar in hypothyroxinemic and hypothyroid condition, is more pronounced under later condition. The resultant downregulation of nuclear myelin binding protein (MBP) and mitochondrial transcripts Cytochrome oxidase III (Cox III) as well as significantly enhanced mitochondrial localization of Bax and reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL accompanied by enhanced release of Cytochrome c and Smac with activation of caspase-3 indicates pronounced apoptosis leading to compromised cellular survival. The similarities of this responsiveness albeit with difference in degree under hypothyroidism and hypothyroxinemic state with adequate availability of T3 are suggestive of an independent role of thyroxine in neocortex development. Taken together, this study brings forth the neurophysiological aspects of hypothyroxinemia and underscores the importance of adequate iodine nutrition along with mandatory thyroxin monitoring during pregnancy and after birth.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

7254384,Effects on transthyretin in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid by DHA-rich n - 3 fatty acid supplementation in patients with Alzheimer's disease: The OmegAD study,"Transthyretin (TTR) binds amyloid-β (Aβ) and may reduce brain Aβ, a pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD). N - 3 fatty acids (FA), docosahexaenoic (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may increase TTR transcription in rat hippocampus. We studied effects of n - 3 FA supplementation on TTR-levels in patients with AD. Outpatients were randomized to receive 1.7 g DHA and 0.6 g EPA (n - 3/n - 3 group) or placebo (placebo/n - 3 group) during 6 months. After 6 months, all patients received n - 3 FA for another 6 months. TTR and FA were measured in plasma in all subjects, whereas TTR in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured in a subgroup. The study was completed by 89 patients in the n - 3/n - 3 group (75 y, 57% w) and 85 in the placebo/n - 3 group (75 y, 46% w). Baseline plasma-TTR was within normal range in both groups. After 6 months, plasma-TTR decreased in the placebo/n - 3 group (p < 0.001 within and p < 0.015 between the groups). No changes were observed in CSF TTR. From 6 to 12 months when both groups were supplemented, plasma-TTR increased significantly in both groups. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated an increase in TTR over time (p = 0.04) in those receiving n - 3 FA for 12 months. By linear regression analyses, n - 3 FA treatment was independently associated with increased plasma-TTR at 6 months (β = -0.172, p = 0.028). Thus, n - 3 FA treatment appeared to increase plasma-TTR in patients with AD.

SPMs are derivatives of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and may mediate their beneficial effects. It is unknown whether supplementation with PUFAs influences the production of SPMs. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with brain inflammation and reduced levels of SPMs. The OmegAD study is a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial on AD patients, in which placebo or a supplement of 1.7 g DHA and 0.6 g EPA was taken daily for 6 months. Plasma levels of arachidonic acid decreased, and DHA and EPA levels increased after 6 months of n-3 FA treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained before and after the trial. Analysis of the culture medium of PBMCs incubated with amyloid-β 1-40 showed unchanged levels of the SPMs lipoxin A4 and resolvin D1 in the group supplemented with n-3 FAs, whereas a decrease was seen in the placebo group. The changes in SPMs showed correspondence to cognitive changes. Changes in the levels of SPMs were positively correlated to changes in transthyretin. We conclude that supplementation with n-3 PUFAs for 6 months prevented a reduction in SPMs released from PBMCs of AD patients, which was associated with changes in cognitive function.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7273850,Transthyretin as a thyroid hormone carrier: Function revisited,"Thyroid hormones are essential for normal mammalian development and for normal metabolism. Thyroxine (T4) is the principal product synthesized by the thyroid follicles, and triiodothyronine (T3), the biologically active hormone, derives mainly from tissue T4 deiodination. More than 99% of the circulating hormone is bound to plasma proteins, mainly to thyroxine-binding globulin, transthyretin and albumin in man, and to transthyretin and albumin in rodents. The role of plasma proteins in the transport of hormones to target tissues has, for a long time, been controversial. The liver and the choroid plexus are the major sites of transthyretin synthesis, tissues from which transthyretin is secreted into the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. Transthyretin has been proposed to mediate thyroid hormone transfer into the tissues, particularly into the brain across the choroid-plexus-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Studies in a transthyretinnull mice strain have shown conclusively that transthyretin is not indespensable for thyroid hormones' entry into the brain and other tissues, nor for the maintenance of an euthyroid status. An euthyroid status is also observed in man totally deprived of thyroxine-binding globulin and in rats without albumin. Taken together, these results exclude dependence of thyroid hormone homeostasis on any major plasma carrier per se. This evidence agrees with the free hormone hypothesis which states that the biologically significant fraction, that is taken up by the tissues, is the free circulating hormone.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Motor neuropathy and cardiomyopathy evolve in the course of the disease. Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disease leading to decreased levels of lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase and proximal muscle weakness.

For MS analysis, laser microdissection (LMD) is used for amyloid specific sampling. This study aimed to establish a method for selectively extracting amyloids from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens by organic solvent instead of LMD. The extracts using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol, trifluoroethanol (TFE) or hexafluoro-2-propanol from FFPE brain of alzheimer's disease mouse model generated protein bands on SDS-PAGE, and Aβ was identified in the extract of DMF using mass spectrometry. The extract using DMSO from the kidney of a AA amyloidosis patient produced a protein band in SDS-PAGE. This protein band was identified to be serum amyloid A (SAA) by Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Circular dichroism spectrometry revealed that the secondary structures of Aβ and transthyretin were converted to α-helices from β-sheets in TFE. Our results suggest that organic solvents can extract amyloids from FFPE specimens by converting their secondary structure. This method could eliminate the LMD step and simplified amyloid typing by MS analysis. •DMSO, DMF, methanol, TFE and HFIP can extract Aβ specifically from the FFPE brain of a Alzheimer' disease mouse model.•DMSO can extract SAA specifically from a FFPE section of AA amyloidosis.•Secondary structures of Aβ and transthyretin converted from β-sheet to α-helix in TFE.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7307758,Halogen Bonding in Biomimetic Deiodination of Thyroid Hormones and their Metabolites and Dehalogenation of Halogenated Nucleosides,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are key players in the endocrine system and play pivotal roles in carbohydrate and fat metabolism, protein synthesis, overall growth, and brain development. The thyroid gland predominantly produces thyroxine or 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (T4) as a prohormone; three isoforms of a mammalian selenoenzyme-iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO1, DIO2 and DIO3)-catalyze the regioselective deiodination of T4 to produce biologically active and inactive metabolites. Whereas DIO1 catalyzes both 5- and 5'-deiodination of T4, DIO2 and DIO3 selectively mediate 5- and 5'-deiodination, respectively. In this review we discuss the regioselective deiodination of THs in the presence of organochalcogen compounds. Naphthalene-based compounds containing sulfur and/or selenium at the peri positions mediate regioselective 5-deiodination of THs, detailed mechanistic studies having revealed that the heterolytic cleavage of the C-I bond is facilitated by the formation of cooperative Se/S⋅⋅⋅I halogen bonds and Se/S⋅⋅⋅Se chalcogen bonds. We also discuss the biomimetic deiodination of several TH metabolites, including sulfated THs, iodothyronamines, and iodotyrosines.

In order to reveal these mechanisms, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to different concentrations of BDE-99 (0, 0.5, 5, or 50 μg/L) for 28 days and spawned by mating naturally in clean water (without BDE-99). Females exposed to BDE-99 showed significantly lowered thyroxine (T4) levels. Expression of transthyretin (ttr) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (ugt1ab) were down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively. Triiodothyronine (T3) levels in the 0.5 μg/L BDE-99 exposure group was significantly increased. Males showed significantly increased T3 levels, and lowered T4 levels, which were associated with up-regulated and down-regulated expression of deiodinase 2 (deio2) and ugt1ab, respectively. Exposure of adult zebrafish to BDE-99 lead to significantly increased T4 in the 0.5 μg/L BDE-99 exposure group, but in the 50 μg/L BDE-99 exposure group there was significantly reduced T4 in F1 larvae and altered mRNA transcription in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-liver (HPTL) axis.

5439194,Distribution of lead and transthyretin in human eyes,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>The retinal pigment epithelium serves as a defensive barrier to the retina in the same way that the choroid plexus functions in the brain. Previous studies have shown that lead sequestration in the choroid plexus reduces the production and secretion of transthyretin by the choroid plexus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of lead and transthyretin in human eyes and to explore the potential effect of lead on transthyretin in human eyes.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Eight pairs of human eyes were obtained from the New York City Eyebank within 24 hours of postmortem. The eyes were dissected to obtain the aqueous, vitreous, retina, and choroid. Lead and transthyretin concentrations in ocular tissues and liquids were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry for lead and radioimmunoassay for transthyretin. Lead accumulated in the retina at concentrations that were 166, 739, and 5 times higher than those in the aqueous, vitreous, and choroid, respectively (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Lead concentrations in ocular tissues or intraocular liquids did not change as a function of age or gender. The concentration of transthyretin in the vitreous (14.4 +/- 5.1 SE microg/mL) was twice as much as in the aqueous (7.0 +/- 1.1SE microg/mL) and was significantly correlated to that in the retina (r = 0.93, p < 0.005).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>This study indicates that lead accumulates in human ocular tissues, particularly in the retina.

7167725,Transport of prostaglandin E1 across the blood-brain barrier in rats,"The transport of prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was characterized using an in-situ rat brain perfusion technique. The uptake of [(3)H]PGE(1) was not affected by shortchain monocarboxylic acids (butyric acid and valeric acid). On the other hand, uptake of [(3)H]PGE(1) was significantly inhibited by medium-chain monocarboxylic acids such as hexanoic acid, enanthic acid and octanoic acid. These medium-chain monocarboxylic acids showed a more potent inhibitory effect on [(3)H]PGE(1) uptake with increasing number of carbon atoms. In contrast, there was no decrease in [(3)H]PGE(1) transport by any dicarboxylic acids with 5-8 carbon atoms. Valproic acid decreased [(3)H]PGE(1) uptake, whereas p-aminohippuric acid, a substrate for the organic anion transporter family, did not inhibit [(3)H]PGE(1) transport. Bromocresol green, an inhibitor of prostaglandin transporter (PGT), strongly decreased [(3)H]PGE(1) transport across the BBB. In addition, digoxin and taurocholate, substrates for organic anion transporting polypeptide subtype 2 (Oatp2), significantly inhibited [(3)H]PGE(1) uptake. RT-PCR analysis revealed that PGT mRNA and Oatp2 mRNA are expressed in a capillary-rich fraction from rat brain.

7335671,Changes in the central component of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in a rabbit model of prolonged critical illness,"Introduction: Prolonged critically ill patients reveal low circulating thyroid hormone levels without a rise in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This condition is labeled ""low 3,5,3'-tri-iodothyronine (T3) syndrome"" or ""nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTI)"" or ""euthyroid sick syndrome"". Despite the low circulating and peripheral tissue thyroid hormone levels, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) expression in the hypothalamus is reduced and it remains unclear which mechanism is responsible. We set out to study whether increased hypothalamic T3availability could reflect local thyrotoxicosis and explain feedback inhibition-induced suppression of the TRH gene in the context of the low T3syndrome in prolonged critical illness.Methods: Healthy rabbits were compared with prolonged critically ill, parenterally fed animals. We visualized TRH mRNA in the hypothalamus by in situ-hybridization and measured mRNA levels for the type II iodothyronine diodinase (D2), the thyroid hormone transporters monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 8, MCT10 and organic anion co-transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) and the thyroid hormone receptors Î± (TRÎ±) and Î² (TRÎ²) in the hypothalamus. We also measured the activity of the D2 and type III iodothyronine deiodinase (D3) enzymes.Results: In the hypothalamus of prolonged critically ill rabbits with low circulating T3 and TSH, we observed decreased TRH mRNA, increased D2 mRNA and increased MCT10 and OATP1C1 mRNA while MCT8 gene expression was unaltered as compared with healthy controls. This coincided with low hypothalamic thyroxine (T4) and low-normal T3concentrations, without a change at the thyroid hormone receptor level.Conclusions: Although expression of D2 and of the thyroid hormone transporters MCT10 and OATP1C1 were increased in the hypothalamus of prolonged critical ill animals, hypothalamic T4and T3content or thyroid hormone receptor expression were not elevated. Hence, decreased TRH gene expression, and hereby low TSH and T3 during prolonged critical illness, is not exclusively brought about by hypothalamic thyrotoxicosis, and infer other TRH suppressing factors to play a role.

7130174,Transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy: Evaluation of CSF enhancement on serial T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images following intravenous contrast administration,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CSF enhancement on MR images after intravenous administration of gadolinium chelate, which mimics subarachnoid hemorrhage, has been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CSF enhancement can be seen on serial MR images following administration of contrast material in patients with transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and to assess other ancillary MR findings.METHODS: We serially studied T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images of the brain before, immediately after, and 3, 6, and 24 hours after contrast administration in 6 patients with genetically confirmed transthyretin-related FA-P. By consensus, 2 radiologists assessed the presence, degree, and extent of enhancement of the CSF, leptomeninges, brain parenchyma, and other structures. Statistical analysis was performed to define the difference of the enhancement between the 2 MR imagings.RESULTS: In 3/6 patients with cysteine-for-tyrosine substitutions at position 114 (Tyr114Cys mutations), marked CSF enhancement was observed on the FLAIR images at 3 and 6 hours and on T1-weighted images at 3 hours after contrast administration. Although there was no significant difference between the 2 MR imagings, leptomeningeal enhancement for these 3 patients was evident only on FLAIR images. The labyrinth and vitreous body was also enhanced on postcontrast delayed MR images of these 3 patients. These enhancements were not observed in the other 3 patients with Val30Met mutation. In none of the 6 patients did images demonstrate parenchymal enhancement of the brain.CONCLUSION. In FAP patients with Tyr114Cys mutations, contrast material can leak into the CSF. This finding may depend on the subtype of FAP and be more evident with FLAIR images.

The possibility to visualize other types of amyloid deposits with [C-11] PIB would be of potential clinical importance in early diagnosis and for following therapeutic effects. In the present study, we evaluated in vitro binding of [3 H] PIB to tissues containing transthyretin (ATTR), immunoglobulin light-chain (AL), amyloid protein A (AA) and Ab amyloid. We found significantly higher binding of [H-3] PIB in tissue from systemic amyloidoses than in control tissue, i.e. 4.7 times higher (p<0.05). [H-3] PIB showed the highest affinity to cortex of AD brain (IC50 = 3.84 nM), while IC50 values were much higher for ATTR, AA and AL type of amyloidosis and large variations in affinity were observed even within tissues having the same type of amyloidosis.

7053572,Neural Alterations and Hyperactivity of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis in Oatp1c1 Deficiency,"Background: The thyroid hormones (THs) triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are crucial regulators of brain development and function. Cell-specific transporter proteins facilitate TH uptake and efflux across the cell membrane, and insufficient TH transport causes hypothyroidism and mental retardation. Mutations in the TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8, SLC16A2) and the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1, SLCO1C1) are associated with the psychomotor retardation Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome and juvenile neurodegeneration, respectively. Methods: To understand the mechanisms and test potential treatments for the recently discovered OATP1C1 deficiency, we established an oatp1c1 mutant (oatp1c1(-/-)) zebrafish. Results: oatp1c1 is expressed in endothelial cells, neurons, and astrocytes in zebrafish. The activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and behavioral locomotor activity increased in oatp1c1(-/-) larvae. Neuropathological analysis revealed structural alteration in radial glial cells and shorter neuronal axons in oatp1c1(-/-) larvae and adults. Notably, oatp1c1(-/-) and oatp1c1(-/-)Xmct8(-/-) adults exhibit an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter). Pharmacological assays showed that TH analogs, but not THs, can reduce the size and improve the color of the thyroid gland in adult mutant zebrafish. Conclusion: These results establish a vertebrate model for OATP1C1 deficiency that demonstrates endocrinological, neurological, and behavioral alterations mimicking findings observed in an OATP1C1-deficient patient. Further, the curative effect of TH analogs in the oatp1c1(-/-) zebrafish model may provide a lead toward a treatment modality in human patients.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7053145,"Radiochemical examination of transthyretin (TTR) brain penetration assisted by iododiflunisal, a TTR tetramer stabilizer and a new candidate drug for AD","It is well settled that the amyloidogenic properties of the plasma protein transporter transthyretin (TTR) can be modulated by compounds that stabilize its native tetrameric conformation. TTR is also present in cerebrospinal fluid where it can bind to A beta-peptides and prevent A beta aggregation. We have previously shown that treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) model mice with iododiflunisal (IDIF), a TTR tetramer stabilizing compound, prevents AD pathologies. This evidence positioned IDIF as a new lead drug for AD. In dissecting the mechanism of action of IDIF, we disclose here different labeling strategies for the preparation of I-131-labeled IDIF and I-131- and I-124-labeled TTR, which have been further used for the preparation of IDIF-TTR complexes labeled either on the compound or the protein. The biodistribution of all labeled species after intravenous administration has been investigated in mice using ex vivo and in vivo techniques. Our results confirm the capacity of TTR to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and suggest that the formation of TTR-IDIF complexes enhances BBB permeability of both IDIF and TTR.

7044554,The Human SLC7A5 (LAT1): The Intriguing Histidine/Large Neutral Amino Acid Transporter and Its Relevance to Human Health,"SLC7A5, known as LAT1, belongs to the APC superfamily and forms a heterodimeric amino acid transporter interacting with the glycoprotein CD98 (SLC3A2) through a conserved disulfide. The complex is responsible for uptake of essential amino acids in crucial body districts such as placenta and blood brain barrier. LAT1/CD98 heterodimer has been studied over the years to unravel the transport mechanism and the role of each subunit. Studies conducted in intact cells demonstrated that LAT1/CD98 mediates a Na+ and pH independent antiport of amino acids. Some novel insights into the function of LAT1 derived from studies conducted in proteoliposomes reconstituted with the recombinant human LAT1. Using this experimental tool, it has been demonstrated that the preferred substrate is histidine and that CD98 is not required for transport being, plausibly, involved in routing LAT1 to the plasma membrane. Since a 3D structure of LAT1 is not available, homology models have been built on the basis of the AdiC transporter from E. coli. Crucial residues for substrate recognition and gating have been identified using a combined approach of bioinformatics and site-directed mutagenesis coupled to functional assays. Over the years, the interest around LAT1 increased because this transporter is involved in important human diseases such as neurological disorders and cancer. Therefore, LAT1 became an important pharmacological target together with other nutrient membrane transporters. Moving from knowledge on structure/function relationships, two cysteine residues, lying on the substrate binding site, have been exploited for designing thiol reacting covalent inhibitors.

This study was performed to determine whether L-type amino acid transporters (LAT1/SLC7A5 and LAT2/SLC7A8) contribute to the uptake of pregabalin. Methods: Pregabalin uptake by LATs-transfected HEK293 cells or hCMEC/D3 cells, an in vitro human BBB model, was measured by LC-MS/MS analysis. Expression of LAT1 mRNA in hCMEC/D3 cells was determined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Results: Overexpression of LAT1, but not LAT2, in HEK293 cells significantly increased the cellular uptake of pregabalin, and the LAT1-mediated uptake was saturable with a Km of 0.288 mM. LAT1-mediated amino acid uptake was inhibited specifically and almost completely in the presence of 1 mM pregabalin. The uptake of pregabalin by hCMEC/D3 cells was sodium-independent, saturable (Km = 0.854 mM), and strongly inhibited by large amino acids at 1 mM, 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid, a specific system L inhibitor, at 1 mM and by JPH203, a LAT1-selective inhibitor, at 10 μM. Pregabalin uptake in hCMEC/D3 cells was also decreased by 75% by the silencing of LAT1 gene using LAT1 siRNA.

A rapid response time is a characteristic of many nongenomic actions; the onset of the majority of these effects is within minutes because the action is independent of gene expression and protein synthesis. While only T3 is able to generate a genomic response, the different nongenomic effects may be activated by either T3 or T4 or by other iodothyronine derivatives such as T2.

7438588,The organic anion transport polypeptide 1d1 (Oatp1d1) mediates hepatocellular uptake of phalloidin and microcystin into skate liver,"Organic anion transporting polypeptides (rodent Oatp; human OATP) mediate cellular uptake of numerous organic compounds including xenobiotic toxins into mammalian hepatocytes. In the little skate Leucoraja erinacea a liver-specific Oatp (Oatp1d1, also called sOatp) has been identified and suggested to represent an evolutionarily ancient precursor of the mammalian liver OATP1B1 (human), Oatp1b2 (rat), and OATP1B3 (human). The present study tested whether Oatp1d1 shares functional transport activity of the xenobiotic oligopeptide toxins phalloidin and microcystin with the mammalian liver Oatps/OATPs. The phalloidin analogue [(3)H]-demethylphalloin was taken up into skate hepatocytes with high affinity (Km approximately 0.4 microM), and uptake could be inhibited by phalloidin and a variety of typical Oatp/OATP substrates such as bromosulfophthalein, bile salts, estrone-3-sulfate, cyclosporine A and high concentrations of microcystin-LR (Ki approximately 150 microM). When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes Oatp1d1 increased uptake of demethylphalloin (Km approximately 2.2 microM) and microcystin-LR (Km approximately 27 microM) 2- to 3-fold over water-injected oocytes, whereas the alternative skate liver organic anion transporter, the dimeric Ostalpha/beta, exhibited no phalloidin and only minor microcystin-LR transport. Also, the closest mammalian Oatp1d1 orthologue, the human brain and testis OATP1C1, did not show any phalloidin transport activity. These results demonstrate that the evolutionarily ancient Oatp1d1 is able to mediate uptake of cyclic oligopeptide toxins into skate liver. The findings support the notion that Oatp1d1 is a precursor of the liver-specific mammalian Oatps/OATPs and that its transport properties are closely associated with certain forms of toxic liver injury such as for example protein phosphatase inhibition by the water-borne toxin microcystin.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

The proteins are separated in the first dimension by liquid-phase isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the Rotofor cell and in the second dimension by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in the Preparative cell. The removal of SDS by chloroform/methanol/water, followed by sample preparation with the addition of n-octylglucoside, easily interfaced 2D-LPE with MALDI-TOFMS for analysis of intact proteins. Further characterization by proteolytic digestion is also demonstrated. The knowledge of both the molecular weights of the protein and of the proteolytic fragments obtained by peptide mapping increases specificity for protein identification by searching in protein sequence databases. Two brain-specific proteins in human CSF, cystatin C and transthyretin, were isolated in sufficient quantity for determination of the mass of the whole proteins and their tryptic digest by MALDI-TOFMS.

Since thyroid hormones are known to affect brain development, modulation of these responses to stress by alterations in thyroid hormone status have been investigated in hypothyroid (Hypo) and hyperthyroid (Hyper) rat pups. Changes in ACTH and corticosterone (B) levels were measured under basal and stress conditions (3 min exposure to ether vapors) in neonates of various ages (day 5–21). Basal T4 and corticosterone-binding globulin (CBG) levels were also measured. Hypo pups were obtained from methimazole-treated mothers and hyperthyroidism was induced by daily subcutaneous injections of L-T4 (100 µg/kg BW) from birth on. In Hyper rats, premature onset of ACTH and B responses to stress was observed in 5-day-old rats while significant ACTH and B secretion only appeared by day 10 in vehicle-injected rats. By contrast, ACTH and B responses to stress were delayed in Hypo pups and only occurred by day 21. The lack of ACTH and B responses to stress of 14-day-old Hypo rats could be reversed by one single L-T4 injection (100 µg/kg BW) given 24 h, but not 4 h prior to exposure to stress. On day 21, smaller (p < 0.05) stress-induced ACTH release was observed both in Hypo and Hyper rats compared to intact rats, concomitant with a diminished ACTH secretion following exogenous ovine CRF(10 µg/kg BW, i.p.) administration. T4 treatment increased pituitary ACTH stores and produced marked increases in plasma B (4.5-fold on day 5, 2.5-fold on day 21), and CBG concentrations (2-fold on day 5, 2.6-fold on day 21) at all ages. In contrast, Hypo rats exhibited no changes in pituitary ACTH stores, but reduced plasma CBG concentrations throughout the neonatal period. Basal plasma B levels were increased in Hypo rats on day 5 and 10 comparable on day 14 or diminshed on day 21 as compared to intact rats, suggesting that the normal developmental pattern of B is delayed in hypothyroidism. In conclusion, we have shown that (1) thyroid hormones modulate the onset of ACTH and B responses to stress, most likely via changes in B and CBG concentrations, (2) the lack of ACTH and B response to stress in hypothyroid rats can be restored by one single injection of L-T4 and (3) a diminished ACTH and B response to stress observed at weaning in Hypo and Hyper rats is associated with a decrease in pituitary sensitivity to exogenous CRF.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Additionally, the patient has a lesion in the left putamen region revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and elevated serum T3 levels. The male appeared to have a hemizygous mutation (R271H) in the MCT8 gene that was sequenced directly from genomic DNA and occurred de novo in the maternal germline, as both his mother and his sister were not carriers of the mutation.

7642153,A thyroid hormone challenge in hypothyroid rats identifies T3 regulated genes in the hypothalamus and in models with altered energy balance and glucose homeostasis,"BACKGROUND: The thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) is known to affect energy balance. Recent evidence points to an action of T3 in the hypothalamus, a key area of the brain involved in energy homeostasis, but the components and mechanisms are far from understood. The aim of this study was to identify components in the hypothalamus that may be involved in the action of T3 on energy balance regulatory mechanisms. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were made hypothyroid by giving 0.025% methimazole (MMI) in their drinking water for 22 days. On day 21, half the MMI-treated rats received a saline injection, whereas the others were injected with T3. Food intake and body weight measurements were taken daily. Body composition was determined by magnetic resonance imaging, gene expression was analyzed by in situ hybridization, and T3-induced gene expression was determined by microarray analysis of MMI-treated compared to MMI-T3-injected hypothalamic RNA. RESULTS: Post mortem serum thyroid hormone levels showed that MMI treatment decreased circulating thyroid hormones and increased thyrotropin (TSH). MMI treatment decreased food intake and body weight. Body composition analysis revealed reduced lean and fat mass in thyroidectomized rats from day 14 of the experiment. MMI treatment caused a decrease in circulating triglyceride concentrations, an increase in nonesterified fatty acids, and decreased insulin levels. A glucose tolerance test showed impaired glucose clearance in the thyroidectomized animals. In the brain, in situ hybridization revealed marked changes in gene expression, including genes such as Mct8, a thyroid hormone transporter, and Agrp, a key component in energy balance regulation. Microarray analysis revealed 110 genes to be up- or downregulated with T3 treatment (± 1.3-fold change, p<0.05). Three genes chosen from the differentially expressed genes were verified by in situ hybridization to be activated by T3 in cells located at or close to the hypothalamic ventricular ependymal layer and differentially expressed in animal models of long- and short-term body weight regulation. CONCLUSION: This study identified genes regulated by T3 in the hypothalamus, a key area of the brain involved in homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions.

Affected boys present early in life with neurodevelopment delays but have pleasant dispositions and commonly have elevated serum triiodothyronine. They also have marked axial hypotonia and quadriparesis but surprisingly little spasticity early in their disease course. They do, however, have subtle involuntary movements, most often dystonia. The combination of hypotonia and dystonia presents a neurorehabilitation challenge and explains why spasticity-directed therapies have commonly produced suboptimal responses. Our aim was to better define the spectrum of motor disability and to elucidate the neuroanatomic basis of the motor impairments seen in MCT8 deficiency using clinical observation and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a cohort of 6 affected pediatric patients.

7642156,Effects of isolated positive maternal thyroglobulin antibodies on brain development of offspring in an experimental autoimmune thyroiditis model,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is a very common endocrine disorder in pregnancy. However, the effect of maternal positive thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) on brain development of offspring remains unclear. This study used an experimental autoimmune thyroiditis model in CBA/J mice and determined whether isolated positive maternal TgAb directly affected learning and memory abilities of offspring. METHODS: An experimental autoimmune thyroiditis model was established in CBA/J mice through immunization with murine thyroglobulin (mTg). Measuring thyroid function and serum TgAb titer confirmed the presence of isolated positive maternal TgAb. Offspring serum TgAb titer, MCT8, Reelin, RC3, and BNDF mRNA expression in the brain, and brain histology were measured on postnatal days 0, 10, and 40 (PND0, PND10, PND40), and nerve cell migration (BrdU labeling) at PND40. Morris water maze, long-term potentiation (LTP), and LTP-related factor ERK1/2 levels were measured at PND40 to determine offspring spatial learning and memory development. RESULTS: Maternal serum TgAb titers increased and remained elevated through pregnancy compared to controls. Thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels were normal. The T group offspring (Tg immunized) had higher TgAb titers than the control (C) group. However, antibody titers time-dependently decreased. MCT8, Reelin, RC3, and BDNF mRNA expression in the whole brain were similar in the T and C groups on PND0, PND10, and PND40. Neuronal distribution and BrdU from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were similar in the T and C group offspring. Morris water maze tests, excitatory postsynaptic field potentials, and ERK1/2 levels were also similar between the T and C groups.

7642157,Tissue-specific alterations in thyroid hormone homeostasis in combined Mct10 and Mct8 deficiency,"The monocarboxylate transporter Mct10 (Slc16a10; T-type amino acid transporter) facilitates the cellular transport of thyroid hormone (TH) and shows an overlapping expression with the well-established TH transporter Mct8. Because Mct8 deficiency is associated with distinct tissue-specific alterations in TH transport and metabolism, we speculated that Mct10 inactivation may compromise the tissue-specific TH homeostasis as well. However, analysis of Mct10 knockout (ko) mice revealed normal serum TH levels and tissue TH content in contrast to Mct8 ko mice that are characterized by high serum T3, low serum T4, decreased brain TH content, and increased tissue TH concentrations in the liver, kidneys, and thyroid gland. Surprisingly, mice deficient in both TH transporters (Mct10/Mct8 double knockout [dko] mice) showed normal serum T4 levels in the presence of elevated serum T3, indicating that the additional inactivation of Mct10 partially rescues the phenotype of Mct8 ko mice. As a consequence of the normal serum T4, brain T4 content and hypothalamic TRH expression were found to be normalized in the Mct10/Mct8 dko mice. In contrast, the hyperthyroid situation in liver, kidneys, and thyroid gland of Mct8 ko mice was even more severe in Mct10/Mct8 dko animals, suggesting that in these organs, both transporters contribute to the TH efflux. In summary, our data indicate that Mct10 indeed participates in tissue-specific TH transport and also contributes to the generation of the unusual serum TH profile characteristic for Mct8 deficiency.",t1,No_Chemical,Unclear_ref_type,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642158,"Neuronal 3',3,5-triiodothyronine (T3) uptake and behavioral phenotype of mice deficient in Mct8, the neuronal T3 transporter mutated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome","Thyroid hormone transport into cells requires plasma membrane transport proteins. Mutations in one of these, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), have been identified as underlying cause for the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X-linked mental retardation in which the patients also present with abnormally high 3',3,5-triiodothyronine (T(3)) plasma levels. Mice deficient in Mct8 replicate the thyroid hormone abnormalities observed in the human condition. However, no neurological deficits have been described in mice lacking Mct8. Therefore, we subjected Mct8-deficient mice to a comprehensive immunohistochemical, neurological, and behavioral screen. Several behavioral abnormalities were found in the mutants. Interestingly, some of these behavioral changes are compatible with hypothyroidism, whereas others rather indicate hyperthyroidism. We thus hypothesized that neurons exclusively dependent on Mct8 are in a hypothyroid state, whereas neurons expressing other T(3) transporters become hyperthyroid, if they are exposed directly to the high plasma T(3). The majority of T(3) uptake in primary cortical neurons is mediated by Mct8, but pharmacological inhibition suggested functional expression of additional T(3) transporter classes. mRNAs encoding six T(3) transporters, including L-type amino acid transporters (LATs), were coexpressed with Mct8 in isolated neurons. We then demonstrated Lat2 expression in cultured neurons and throughout murine brain development. In contrast, LAT2 is expressed in microglia in the developing human brain during gestation, but not in neurons. We suggest that lack of functional complementation by alternative thyroid hormone transporters in developing human neurons precipitates the devastating neurodevelopmental phenotype in MCT8-deficient patients, whereas Mct8-deficient mouse neurons are functionally complemented by other transporters, for possibly Lat2.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

For this purpose, Adult male Wistar rats underwent to thyroidectomy to induce hypothyroidism. Behavioral tests, the thyroid profile and hippocampal gene expression were evaluated in control and in thyroidectomized animals. It was observed that thyroidectomized group had a significant increasing in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and a decreasing in thyroxine (T4) levels as well as in triiodothyronine (T3) serum level. It was also observed reduction of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (Mct8), thyroid hormone receptor alfa (Trα1), deiodinase type 2 (Dio2), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (Enpp2) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA expression in hippocampus of thyroidectomized animals. In the forced swimming test, it was verified that thyroidectomy promotes a decrease in time of immobility and climbing when compared with the control group. In summary, we demonstrated that antidepressant behavior in thyroidectomized Wistar rats is induced by hippocampal hypothyroidism.

Mutations in MCT8 are associated with severe psychomotor retardation, high serum T3 and low 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) levels. Here we report three novel MCT8 mutations. Two subjects with the F501del mutation have mild psychomotor retardation with slightly elevated T3 and normal rT3 levels. T3 uptake was mildly affected in F501del fibroblasts and strongly decreased in fibroblasts from other MCT8 patients, while T3 efflux was always strongly reduced. Moreover, type 3 deiodinase activity was highly elevated in F501del fibroblasts, whereas it was reduced in fibroblasts from other MCT8 patients, probably reflecting parallel variation in cellular T3 content. Additionally, T3-responsive genes were markedly upregulated by T3 treatment in F501del fibroblasts but not in fibroblasts with other MCT8 mutations. In conclusion, mutations in MCT8 result in a decreased T3 uptake in skin fibroblasts. The much milder clinical phenotype of patients with the F501del mutation may be correlated with the relatively small decrease in T3 uptake combined with an even greater decrease in T3 efflux. If fibroblasts are representative of central neurons, abnormal brain development associated with MCT8 mutations may be the consequence of either decreased or increased intracellular T3 concentrations.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642203,"Tissue distribution and thyroid hormone effects on mRNA abundance for membrane transporters Mct8, Mct10, and organic anion-transporting polypeptides (Oatps) in a teleost fish","Many of the actions of thyroid hormones (THs) occur via TH binding to intracellular receptors. Although it was long thought that THs diffused passively across plasma membranes, it is now recognized that cellular entry is mediated by a variety of membrane transporter proteins. In this study, we identified cDNAs encoding the TH transporters monocarboxylate transferases 8 (mct8) and 10 (mct10) as well as eight distinct organic anion-transporting polypeptide (oatp) proteins from fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Analysis of the tissue distribution of transporter mRNAs revealed that mct8 and mct10 transcripts were both abundant in liver, but also present at lower levels in brain, gonad and other tissues. Transcripts encoding oatp1c1 were highly abundant in brain, liver and gonad, and exhibited significant sex differences in the liver and gonad. Treatment of adult male minnows with 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) or the goitrogen methimazole altered gene transcript abundance for several transporters. Fish given exogenous T3 had reduced mct8 and oapt1c1 mRNA levels in the liver compared to methimazole-treated fish. In the brain, transcripts for mct8, mct10, oatp2b1, and oatp3a1 were each reduced in abundance in fish with elevated T3.

7642206,Monocarboxylate transporter 8 in neuronal cell growth,"Thyroid hormones are essential for the normal growth and development of the fetus, and even small alterations in maternal thyroid hormone status during early pregnancy may be associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities in childhood. Mutations in the novel and specific thyroid hormone transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) have been associated with severe neurodevelopmental impairment. However, the mechanism by which MCT8 influences neural development remains poorly defined. We have therefore investigated the effect of wild-type (WT) MCT8, and the previously reported L471P mutant, on the growth and function of human neuronal precursor NT2 cells as well as MCT8-null JEG-3 cells. HA-tagged WT MCT8 correctly localized to the plasma membrane in NT2 cells and increased T(3) uptake in both cell types. In contrast, L471P MCT8 was largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and displayed no T(3) transport activity. Transient overexpression of WT and mutant MCT8 proteins failed to induce endoplasmic reticular stress or apoptosis. However, MCT8 overexpression significantly repressed cell proliferation in each cell type in both the presence and absence of the active thyroid hormone T(3) and in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, L471P MCT8 showed no such influence. Finally, small interfering RNA depletion of endogenous MCT8 resulted in increased cell survival and decreased T(3) uptake. Given that T(3) stimulated proliferation in embryonic neuronal NT2 cells, whereas MCT8 repressed cell growth, these data suggest an entirely novel role for MCT8 in addition to T(3) transport, mediated through the modulation of cell proliferation in the developing brain.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642209,Uptake and efflux of the peptidic delta-opioid receptor agonist,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and organic anion transporting polypeptides (Oatp) are expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). There is little functional evidence for Oatp-mediated transport at the BBB. The peptidic delta opioid-receptor agonist [D-penicillamine(2,5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) is a substrate of mdr1a P-gp and Oatp2. The present study evaluated the influence of these transporters on brain uptake of DPDPE by in situ perfusion in mice. Brain uptake was increased approximately 12-fold in mice lacking P-gp in the BBB, but the P-gp inhibitor dexverapamil did not increase uptake in P-gp-competent mice. In P-gp-deficient mice, DPDPE uptake was saturable (K(m) approximately 24 mM), and was inhibited by dexverapamil and the Oatp2 substrates digoxin, estradiol-17beta-glucuronide and fexofenadine. These results confirm P-gp-mediated efflux of DPDPE, and suggest functional uptake transport of DPDPE by Oatp, at the murine BBB.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
7642210,Impact of Oatp1c1 deficiency on thyroid hormone metabolism and action in the mouse brain,"Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1c1 (Oatp1c1) (also known as Slco1c1 and Oatp14) belongs to the family of Oatp and has been shown to facilitate the transport of T(4). In the rodent brain, Oatp1c1 is highly enriched in capillary endothelial cells and choroid plexus structures where it may mediate the entry of T(4) into the central nervous system. Here, we describe the generation and first analysis of Oatp1c1-deficient mice. Oatp1c1 knockout (KO) mice were born with the expected frequency, were not growth retarded, and developed without any overt neurological abnormalities. Serum T(3) and T(4) concentrations as well as renal and hepatic deiodinase type 1 expression levels were indistinguishable between Oatp1c1 KO mice and control animals. Hypothalamic TRH and pituitary TSH mRNA levels were not affected, but brain T(4) and T(3) content was decreased in Oatp1c1-deficient animals. Moreover, increased type 2 and decreased type 3 deiodinase activities indicate a mild hypothyroid situation in the brain of Oatp1c1 KO mice. Consequently, mRNA expression levels of gene products positively regulated by T(3) in the brain were down-regulated. This central nervous system-specific hypothyroidism is presumably caused by an impaired passage of T(4) across the blood-brain barrier and indicates a unique function of Oatp1c1 in facilitating T(4) transport despite the presence of other thyroid hormone transporters such as Mct8.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642212,The tricyclic antidepressant desipramine inhibits T3 import into primary neurons,"Transport of thyroid hormones across the plasma membrane is required for binding to their nuclear receptors. Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a plasma membrane thyroid hormone transport protein, which has recently gained much attention, since mutations in MCT8 are associated with severe mental retardation in patients afflicted with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. MCT8 is expressed along the blood-brain-barrier and on central neurons. We have found that desipramine (DMI), a tricyclic antidepressant, acts as an inhibitor of thyroid hormone transport by MCT8. Uptake of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T(3)) into primary cortical neurons could be blocked with desipramine as well as with the known, but unspecific, inhibitor bromosulphtalein (BSP). T(3) uptake by neurons derived from Mct8-deficient cells was not further decreased by DMI. In a heterologous expression system, both human MCT8 and its close homolog, MCT10, were sensitive to inhibition by DMI. Kinetic experiments demonstrated a non-competitive mode of inhibition. Numerous interactions between thyroid hormones, depressive symptoms, and antidepressant treatments have been reported in the literature.

7642218,Thyroid hormone transporters--functions and clinical implications,"The cellular influx and efflux of thyroid hormones are facilitated by transmembrane protein transporters. Of these transporters, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is the only one specific for the transport of thyroid hormones and some of their derivatives. Mutations in SLC16A2, the gene that encodes MCT8, lead to an X-linked syndrome with severe neurological impairment and altered concentrations of thyroid hormones. Histopathological analysis of brain tissue from patients who have impaired MCT8 function indicates that brain lesions start prenatally, and are most probably the result of cerebral hypothyroidism. A Slc16a2 knockout mouse model has revealed that Mct8 is an important mediator of thyroid hormone transport, especially T3, through the blood-brain barrier. However, unlike humans with an MCT8 deficiency, these mice do not have neurological impairment. One explanation for this discrepancy could be differences in expression of the T4 transporter OATP1C1 in the blood-brain barrier; OATP1C1 is more abundant in rodents than in primates and permits the passage of T4 in the absence of T3 transport, thus preventing full cerebral hypothyroidism. In this Review, we discuss the relevance of thyroid hormone transporters in health and disease, with a particular focus on the pathophysiology of MCT8 mutations.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642219,Thyroid hormone-regulated mouse cerebral cortex genes are differentially dependent on the source of the hormone: a study in monocarboxylate transporter-8- and deiodinase-2-deficient mice,"Thyroid hormones influence brain development through the control of gene expression. The concentration of the active hormone T(3) in the brain depends on T(3) transport through the blood-brain barrier, mediated in part by the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (Mct8/MCT8) and the activity of type 2 deiodinase (D2) generating T(3) from T(4). The relative roles of each of these pathways in the regulation of brain gene expression is not known. To shed light on this question, we analyzed thyroid hormone-dependent gene expression in the cerebral cortex of mice with inactivated Mct8 (Slc16a2) and Dio2 genes, alone or in combination. We used 34 target genes identified to be controlled by thyroid hormone in microarray comparisons of cerebral cortex from wild-type control and hypothyroid mice on postnatal d 21. Inactivation of the Mct8 gene (Mct8KO) was without effect on the expression of 31 of these genes. Normal gene expression in the absence of the transporter was mostly due to D2 activity because the combined disruption of Mct8 and Dio2 led to similar effects as hypothyroidism on the expression of 24 genes. Dio2 disruption alone did not affect the expression of positively regulated genes, but, as in hypothyroidism, it increased that of negatively regulated genes. We conclude that gene expression in the Mct8KO cerebral cortex is compensated in part by D2-dependent mechanisms. Intriguingly, positive or negative regulation of genes by thyroid hormone is sensitive to the source of T(3) because Dio2 inactivation selectively affects the expression of negatively regulated genes.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642220,Hypothyroidism and brain developmental players,"Most of our knowledge on the mechanisms of thyroid hormone (TH) dependent brain development is based on clinical observations and animal studies of maternal/fetal hypothyroidism. THs play an essential role in brain development and hormone deficiency during critical phases in fetal life may lead to severe and permanent brain damage. Maternal hypothyroidism is considered the most common cause of fetal TH deficiency, but the problem may also arise in the fetus. In the case of congenital hypothyroidism due to defects in fetal thyroid gland development or hormone synthesis, clinical symptoms at birth are often mild as a result of compensatory maternal TH supply. TH transporters (THTs) and deiodinases (Ds) are important regulators of intracellular triiodothyronine (T3) availability and therefore contribute to the control of thyroid receptors (TRs)-dependent CNS development and early embryonic life. Defects in fetal THTs or Ds may have more impact on fetal brain since they can result in intracellular T3 deficiency despite sufficient maternal TH supply. One clear example is the recent discovery of mutations in the TH transporter (monocarboxylate transporter 8; MCT8) that could be linked to a syndrome of severe and non reversible psychomotor retardation. Even mild and transient changes in maternal TH levels can directly affect and alter the gene expression profile, and thus disturb fetal brain development. Animal studies are needed to increase our understanding of the exact role of THTs and Ds in prenatal brain development.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642256,Lack of action of exogenously administered T3 on the fetal rat brain despite expression of the monocarboxylate transporter 8,"Mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene (MCT8, SLC16A2) cause the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X-linked syndrome of severe intellectual deficit and neurological impairment. Mct8 transports thyroid hormones (T4 and T3), and the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is likely caused by lack of T3 transport to neurons during critical periods of fetal brain development. To evaluate the role of Mct8 in thyroid hormone action in the fetal brain we administered T4 or T3 to thyroidectomized pregnant dams treated with methyl-mercapto-imidazol to produce maternal and fetal hypothyroidism. Gene expression was then measured in the fetal cerebral cortex. T4 increased Camk4, Sema3c, and Slc7a3 expression, but T3 was without effect. To investigate the cause for the lack of T3 action we analyzed the expression of organic anion transport polypeptide (Oatp14, Slco1c1), a T4 transporter, and Mct8 (Slc16a2), a T4 and T3 transporter, by confocal microscopy. Both proteins were present in the brain capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier and in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. It is concluded that T4 from the maternal compartment influences gene expression in the fetal cerebral cortex, possibly after transport via organic anion transporter polypeptide and/or Mct8, and conversion to T3 in the astrocytes. On the other hand, T3 does not reach the target neurons despite the presence of Mct8. The data indicate that T4, through local deiodination, provides most T3 in the fetal rat brain. The role of Mct8 as a T3 transporter in the fetal rat brain is therefore uncertain.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642258,Knockdown of monocarboxylate transporter 8 (mct8) disturbs brain development and locomotion in zebrafish,"Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is an inherited disorder of brain development characterized by severe psychomotor retardation. This X-linked disease is caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), an important thyroid hormone transporter in brain neurons. MCT8-knockout mice lack the 2 major neurological symptoms of AHDS, namely locomotor problems and cognitive impairment. The pathological mechanism explaining the symptoms is still obscure, and no cure for this condition is known. The development of an animal model that carries MCT8-related neurological symptoms is warranted. We have employed morpholino-based gene knockdown to create zebrafish deficient for mct8. Knockdown of mct8 results in specific symptoms in the thyroid axis and brain. The mct8-morphants showed impaired locomotor behavior and brain development. More specifically, we observed maldevelopment of the cerebellum and mid-hindbrain boundary and apoptotic clusters in the zebrafish brain. The mRNA expression of zebrafish orthologs of mammalian TSH, thyroid hormone transporters, and deiodinases was altered in mct8 morphants. In particular, deiodinase type 3 gene expression was consistently up-regulated in zebrafish mct8 morphants. The thyroid hormone metabolite tetrac, but not T3, partly ameliorated the affected phenotype and locomotion disability of morphant larvae. Our results show that mct8 knockdown in zebrafish larvae results in disturbances in the thyroid axis, brain, and locomotion behavior, which is congruent with the clinical aspect of impaired locomotion and cognition in patients with AHDS.

7642260,Functional characterization of rat brain-specific organic anion transporter (Oatp14) at the blood-brain barrier: High affinity transporter for thyroxine,"Oatp14/blood-brain barrier-specific anion transporter 1 (Slc21a14) is a novel member of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp/OATP) family. Northern blot analysis revealed predominant expression of Oatp14 in the brain, and Western blot analysis revealed its expression in the brain capillary and choroid plexus. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that Oatp14 is expressed in the border of the brain capillary endothelial cells. When expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, Oatp14 transports thyroxine (T4; prothyroid hormone) (Km = 0.18 mum), as well as amphipathic organic anions such as 17beta estradiol-d-17beta-glucuronide (Km = 10 mum), cerivastatin (Km = 1.3 mum), and troglitazone sulfate (Km = 0.76 mum). The uptake of triiodothyronine (T3), an active form produced from T4, was significantly greater in Oatp14-expressed cells than in vector-transfected cells, but the transport activity for T3 was approximately 6-fold lower that for T4. The efflux of T4, preloaded into the cells, from Oatp14-expressed cells was more rapid than that from vector-transfected cells (0.032 versus 0.006 min-1). Therefore, Oatp14 can mediate a bidirectional transport of T4. Sulfobromophthalein, taurocholate, and estrone sulfate were potent inhibitors for Oatp14, whereas digoxin, p-aminohippurate, or leukotriene C4, or organic cations such as tetraetheylammonium or cimetidine had no effect. The expression levels of Oatp14 mRNA and protein were up- and down-regulated under hypo- and hyperthyroid conditions, respectively. Therefore, it may be speculated that Oatp14 plays a role in maintaining the concentration of T4 and, ultimately, T3 in the brain by transporting T4 from the circulating blood to the brain.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

7642112,Mct8 and trh co-expression throughout the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus is modified by dehydration-induced anorexia in rats,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a neuropeptide with endocrine and neuromodulatory effects. TRH from the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) participates in the control of energy homeostasis; as a neuromodulator TRH has anorexigenic effects. Negative energy balance decreases PVN TRH expression and TSH concentration; in contrast, a particular model of anorexia (dehydration) induces in rats a paradoxical increase in TRH expression in hypophysiotropic cells from caudal PVN and high TSH serum levels, despite their apparent hypothalamic hyperthyroidism and low body weight. We compared here the mRNA co-expression pattern of one of the brain thyroid hormones' transporters, the monocarboxylate transporter-8 (MCT8) with that of TRH in PVN subdivisions of dehydration-induced anorexic (DIA) and control rats. Our aim was to identify whether a low MCT8 expression in anorexic rats could contribute to their high TRH mRNA content.We registered daily food intake and body weight of 7-day DIA and control rats and analyzed TRH and MCT8 mRNA co-expression throughout the PVN by double in situ hybridization assays. We found that DIA rats showed increased number of TRHergic cells in caudal PVN, as well as a decreased percentage of TRH-expressing neurons that co-expressed MCT8 mRNA signal. Results suggest that the reduced proportion of double TRH/MCT8 expressing cells may be limiting the entry of hypothalamic triiodothyronine to the greater number of TRH-expressing neurons from caudal PVN and be in part responsible for the high TRH expression in anorexia rats and for the lack of adaptation of their hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis to their low food intake.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Our goal was to quantify their changes in children with cancer during chemotherapy, and to correlate them to clinical condition and type of drugs. DESIGN: During a 3-month period all patients admitted for chemotherapy to the paediatric oncology ward were evaluated for inclusion. Patients with brain tumours, neuroblastoma (cranio)spinal irradiation and use of dexamethasone before the first blood sample were excluded. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma concentrations of T4, T3, rT3, thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroglobulin (Tg), TSH, IGF-1, cortisol, PRL and physical well-being by means of questionnaires were measured before and during chemotherapy. RESULTS: In 19 children, 46 courses of chemotherapy and 123 plasma samples were analysed. During chemotherapy, mean concentrations of TSH, T3, Tg and cortisol decreased to 53, 67, 69 and 15% of the baseline value, respectively. Mean plasma rT3 increased to 217% of baseline. In 87% of all courses, one or more thyroid parameter(s) was aberrant. Furthermore, in 23 samples (19%) from 10 patients (53%), the concentration of IGF-1 was below the reference value (adjusted for sex and age). Small changes were seen in scores for clinical condition but none was related to a change in thyroid function determinant. Most changes in thyroid hormones could be attributed to using dexamethasone.

7641999,Transthyretin: a choroid plexus-specific transport protein in human brain. The 1986 S. Weir Mitchell award,"Plasma transthyretin (TTR, formerly called prealbumin) is a 55-kd protein that participates in the plasma transport of both thyroxine and retinol (vitamin A). TTR concentrations are disproportionately high in human ventricular CSF, suggesting that TTR is either selectively transported across or synthesized de novo within the blood-CSF barrier. To address this question, we adopted a molecular genetic approach; after isolating a cDNA clone encoding human TTR, we previously demonstrated specific TTR messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis in rat choroid plexus. We have now extended these investigations to the human brain. Northern analysis of postmortem brain homogenates revealed abundant TTR mRNA in choroid plexus, but not in cerebellum or cerebral cortex. Choroid plexus mRNA was readily translated into TTR preprotein in an in vitro translation system. An immunocytochemical survey of human postmortem brain sections revealed the presence of TTR protein specifically and uniquely in the cytoplasm of choroid plexus epithelial cells; these results were corroborated at the mRNA level by an extensive survey of whole rat-brain sections by in situ hybridization. Therefore, within the mammalian CNS, TTR is the first known protein synthesized solely by the choroid plexus, suggesting a special role for TTR in the brain or CSF.

Thirty-one wild-type patients (median age, 76.7 years; 93.5% men) with a median disease duration of 55.6 months and mild to moderate heart failure (96.8%; New York Heart Association, classes I-II) were enrolled. Thirty of 31 patients (96.8%) achieved TTR stabilization after 6 weeks and 25 of 28 patients (89.3%) after 12 months. After 12 months of treatment, 3 patients discontinued prematurely, 2 patients died, 7 patients were hospitalized because of cardiovascular events, 20 of 28 patients demonstrated preserved New York Heart Association classification status, but 15 of 31 (48.4%) patients had clinical progression (eg, admission for cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, and syncope).

Follow-up analyses indicated that in men, low testosterone levels (OR=.94, 95% CI=.88 to 1.00) were a risk factor for a sharp cognitive decline after 2 years, perhaps indicative of dementia.

Conversely, women at risk for a sharp drop in cognitive function showed some evidence for higher calculated free testosterone levels at baseline.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Results replicate earlier cross-sectional findings that high levels of sex steroids are not associated with better cognitive function in older people. In men, age accelerated endocrinological change could be associated with dementia pathology.<br /><br /><strong>GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: </strong>These data do not support increasing testosterone levels to prevent cognitive decline in men and women over 65 years of age.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
7642040,Transport of thyroid hormones to target tissues,"Endemic iodine deficiency is associated with maternal hypothyroxinemia and a relatively high incidence of neurological disorders in the offspring. The previous assumption that the placenta is impermeable to maternal thyroid hormone, has resulted in the erroneous suggestion that iodine per se has an essential role in brain development. Furthermore, the observed factorial rise in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) in pregnancy has often been misinterpreted as preventing thyroid hormone loss to either the fetal compartment or excretory systems. However, physiochemical analysis of the role of specific binding proteins in hormone delivery, combined with epidemiological evidence and evolutionary considerations has led us to postulate that a) maternal thyroxine (T4) is transported to the fetus, and is of crucial importance in early fetal development, and b) TBG forms part of a control system specifically designed to maintain at an optimal level the T4 environment to which the developing fetus is exposed. Placental transfer of maternal T4 in a variety of mammalian species (including humans) is now well established. Further experimental studies in rats have shown that perturbation of the intrauterine thyroid hormone environment during critical phases of brain development results in a spectrum of biochemical dysgenesis. For example, in fetal brains deriving from hypothyroxinemic (Tx) rat dams, severe disruption of phosphate metabolism is observed and the ontogenesis of two enzyme activities associated with growth control, protein kinase C and ornithine decarboxylase, are compromised. Development of brain function is also impaired, as evidenced by the dysgenesis of certain neurotransmitter metabolic activities (choline acetyltransferase and DOPA decarboxylase).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642042,Evolutionary changes to transthyretin: evolution of transthyretin biosynthesis,"Thyroid hormones are involved in growth and development, particularly of the brain. Thus, it is imperative that these hormones get from their site of synthesis to their sites of action throughout the body and the brain. This role is fulfilled by thyroid hormone distributor proteins. Of particular interest is transthyretin, which in mammals is synthesized in the liver, choroid plexus, meninges, retinal and ciliary pigment epithelia, visceral yolk sac, placenta, pancreas and intestines, whereas the other thyroid hormone distributor proteins are synthesized only in the liver. Transthyretin is synthesized by all classes of vertebrates; however, the tissue specificity of transthyretin gene expression varies widely between classes. This review summarizes what is currently known about the evolution of transthyretin synthesis in vertebrates and presents hypotheses regarding tissue-specific synthesis of transthyretin in each vertebrate class.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642043,Regulation of transthyretin by thyroid hormones in fish,"Transthyretin (TTR) is a thyroid hormone-binding protein (THBP) which in its tetrameric form transports thyroid hormones (THs), thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine (T(3)) in the blood of vertebrates. The principal site of production of TTR is the liver but in the sea bream TTR mRNA is also present in the heart, intestine and brain. The regulation of TTR is unstudied in fish and the normal circulating level of this THBP is unknown. The aim of the present study was to establish factors which regulate TTR production in fish. As a first step a number of tools were generated; sea bream recombinant TTR (sbrTTR) and specific sbrTTR antisera which were used to establish an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for measuring TTR plasma levels. Subsequently, an experiment was conducted to determine the influence of THs on TTR production. Circulating physiological levels of TTR in sea bream determined by ELISA are approximately 3.8microgml(-1). Administration of T(3) and T(4) to sea bream significantly increased (p<0.001 and p<0.005, respectively) the concentration of circulating TTR ( approximately or = 11.5microgml(-1)) in relation to control fish, but did not change gene transcription in the liver. Methimazol (MMI) an antithyroid agent, failed to significantly reduce circulating THs below control levels but significantly increased (p<0.005) plasma TTR levels (approximately or = 10.8microgml(-1)) and decreased (p<0.05) transcription in the liver. Future studies will aim to elucidate in more detail these regulatory pathways.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Rat choroid plexus contained 4.4 micrograms and rat liver 0.39 micrograms transthyretin mRNA per gram wet tissue. The specific radioactivity of transthyretin isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of rats 60 min after intravenous injection of [14C]leucine was greater than 50 times that of transthyretin from serum. After adding [14C]leucine to the perfusion medium of an in vitro perfused sheep choroid plexus, highly radioactive transthyretin was isolated from freshly secreted cerebrospinal fluid collected from the exposed choroid plexus surface. Secretion of newly synthesized transthyretin into the perfusion medium could not be demonstrated. After intravenous injection of [125I]-thyroxine into rats, a maximum in the curve of radioactivity in tissue plotted against time after injection was observed first for choroid plexus, thereafter for cerebrospinal fluid, and still later for cortex and striatum. Based on the obtained data, a hypothesis is derived for the mechanism of the transport of thyroid hormones from the bloodstream to the brain involving transthyretin synthesized in choroid plexus and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Here we studied the thyroid axis of adult female mice lacking neuromedin B receptor (NBR-KO), compared to wild type (WT) littermates. They exhibited slight increase in serum TSH (18%), with normal pituitary expression of mRNA coding for α-glycoprotein subunit (Cga), but reduced TSH β-subunit mRNA (Tshb, 41%), lower intra-pituitary TSH content (24%) and increased thyroid hormone transporter MCT-8 (Slc16a2, 44%) and thyroid hormone receptor β mRNA expression (Thrb, 39%). NBR-KO mice exhibited normal thyroxine (T4) and reduced triiodothyronine (T3) (30%), with no alterations in the intra-thyroidal content of T4 and T3 or thyroid morphological changes. Hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) mRNA (Trh) was increased (68%), concomitant with a reduction in type 2 deiodinase mRNA (Dio2, 30%) and no changes in MCT-8 and thyroid hormone receptor mRNA expression. NBR-KO mice exhibited a 56% higher increase in serum TSH in response to an acute single intraperitoneal injection of TRH concomitant with a non-significant increase in pituitary TRH receptor (Trhr) mRNA at basal state. The phenotype of female NBR-KO mice at the hypothalamus-pituitary axis revealed alterations in pituitary and hypothalamic gene expression, associated with reduced serum T3, and higher TSH response to TRH, with apparently normal thyroid morphology and hormonal production. Thus, results confirm that neuromedin B pathways are importantly involved in secretory pathways of TSH and revealed its participation in the in vivo regulation of gene expression of TSH β-subunit and pituitary MCT8 and Thrb and hypothalamic TRH and type 2 deiodinase.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642048,Neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms in the choroid plexus-cerebrospinal fluid system,"The CSF is often regarded as merely a mechanical support for the brain, as well as an unspecific sink for waste products from the CNS. New methodology in receptor autoradiography, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology has revealed the presence of many different neuroendocrine substances or their corresponding receptors in the main CSF-forming structure, the choroid plexus. Both older research on the sympathetic nerves and recent studies of peptide neurotransmitters in the choroid plexus support a neurogenic regulation of choroid plexus CSF production and other transport functions. Among the endocrine substances present in blood and CSF, 5-HT, ANP, vasopressin and the IGFs have high receptor concentrations in the choroid plexus and have been shown to influence choroid plexus function. Finally, the choroid plexus produces the growth factor IGF-II and a number of transport proteins, most importantly transthyretin, that might regulate hormone transport from blood to brain. These studies suggest that the choroid plexus-CSF system could constitute an important pathway for neuroendocrine signalling in the brain, although clearcut evidence for such a role is still largely lacking.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Herein, we report that the TTR gene is expressed in skeletal muscle tissue and up-regulated during myotube formation in C2C12 cells. TTR silencing (TTRkd) significantly reduced myogenin expression and myotube formation, whereas myogenin silencing (MYOGkd) did not have any effect on TTR gene expression. Both TTRkd and MYOGkd led to a decrease in calcium channel related genes including Cav1.1, STIM1 and Orai1. A significant decrease in intracellular T4 uptake during myogenesis was observed in TTRkd cells. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that TTR initiates myoblast differentiation via affecting expression of the genes involved during early stage of myogenesis and the genes related to calcium channel.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642051,Transthyretin expression in the rat brain: Effect of thyroid functional state and role in thyroxine transport,"Rats were made hypo- or hyperthyroid to study the role of thyroid hormones on cerebral transthyretin (TTR) mRNA expression. TTR mRNA was detected by Northern blot in rat liver, choroid plexus and meninges but not in cultured astrocytes or cultured cerebral endothelial cells. No changes were found in the levels of TTR mRNA in liver, choroid plexus or meninges in hypo- or hyperthyroid rats compared with the controls. In order to investigate the main route of thyroxine transport from blood to brain, the distribution of [125I]thyroxine in the brain was studied after intravenous (i.v.) and intraventricular (i.v.c.) injection by both direct counting and autoradiography. While distribution of [125I]thyroxine could be seen throughout the brain parenchyma after i.v. injection, the labelling was confined to the CSF spaces after i.v.c. administration. When protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide treatment and [125I]thyroxine was injected intravenously, the uptake of [125I]thyroxine in the choroid plexus decreased while the uptake in the cerebral cortex increased. This indicates that thyroxine is transported into the brain primarily through the blood-brain barrier and not via the choroid plexus and CSF. We discuss the possibility that TTR has a role in the distribution of thyroxine throughout the brain.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642052,"Isolation, characterization, cDNA cloning and gene expression of an avian transthyretin. Implications for the evolution of structure and function of transthyretin in vertebrates","A chicken liver cDNA library was constructed in bacteriophage lambda gt10. A full-length transthyretin cDNA clone was identified by screening with rat transthyretin cDNA and was sequenced. A three-dimensional model of chicken transthyretin was obtained by computer-graphics-based prediction from the derived amino acid sequence for chicken transthyretin and from the structure of human transthyretin determined by X-ray diffraction analysis [Blake, C.C.F., Geisow, M.J., Oatley, S.J., Rérat, B. & Rérat, C. (1978) J. Mol. Biol. 121, 339-356]. The similarity of the amino acid sequences of chicken and human transthyretins was 75% overall and 100% for the central channel containing the thyroxine-binding site. Also, the organization of the transthyretin gene into exons and introns and the tissue specificity of expression of the transthyretin gene were similar in chicken and mammals, despite an evolutionary distance of about 3 x 10(8) years from their common ancestor, the Cotylosaurus. By far the highest levels of transthyretin mRNA were found in choroid plexus. The data suggest a fundamental role for the cerebral expression of transthyretin in all vertebrates. It has been proposed that this role is the transport of thyroxine from the bloodstream to the brain [Schreiber, G., Aldred, A.R., Jaworowski, A., Nilsson, C., Achen, M.G. & Segal, M.B. (1990) Am. J.

7642053,Thyroid hormone distribution in the mouse brain: the role of transthyretin,"Transthyretin is the major thyroxine-binding protein in the plasma of rodents, and the main thyroxine-binding protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of both rodents and humans. The choroid plexus synthesizes transthyretin and secretes it to the cerebrospinal fluid. Although it was suggested that transthyretin might play an important role in mediating thyroxine transfer from the blood into the brain across the choroid plexus-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, newer findings question this hypothesis. Because thyroid hormone passage across brain barriers is a precondition for its action in the CNS, and because brain is an important target of thyroid hormone action, we investigated the role of transthyretin in mediating thyroid hormone access to and distribution within the brain in a transthyretin-null mouse model system. In this report we describe the results derived from use of film autoradiography, a technique that yields definitive morphological results. Film autoradiograms were prepared at 3 and 19 h after intravenous injection of either high specific activity [(125)I]thyroxine or [(125)I]triiodothyronine. Image analyses were designed to demonstrate regional changes in hormone distribution, and to highlight alterations in iodothyronine delivery from ventricles to brain parenchyma. We find no qualitative or quantitative differences in these parameters between the transthyretin-null and the wild-type mouse brain after either [(125)I]thyroxine or [(125)I]triiodothyronine administration. The data presented here now provide definitive evidence that, under standard laboratory conditions, transthyretin is not required for thyroid hormone access to or distribution within the mouse brain.

7642054,Transthyretin Induces Insulin-like Growth Factor I Nuclear Translocation Regulating Its Levels in the Hippocampus,"Transthyretin (TTR) is the carrier protein of thyroxine (T4) and binds to retinol-binding protein (RBP)-retinol complex. It is mainly synthesized by both liver and choroid plexuses of the brain. Besides these properties, it has a neuroprotective role in several contexts such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral ischemia. Activation of insulin-like growth factor receptor I (IGF-IR) pathways and increased levels of TTR are associated with absence of neurodegeneration in an AD mouse model. In the present study, we verified that young/adult TTR null mice had decreased levels of IGF-IR in the hippocampus, but not in choroid plexus when compared with wild-type age-matched controls. Moreover, we could also demonstrate that conditional silencing of peripheral TTR did not have any influence in hippocampal IGF-IR levels, indicating that TTR effect on IGF-IR levels is due to TTR mainly synthesized in the choroid plexus. In vitro cellular studies, using NIH3T3 cell line and primary cultured hippocampal neurons, we showed that TTR upregulates IGF-IR at the transcription and translation levels and that is dependent on receptor internalization. Using a GFP-IGF-IR fusion protein, we also found that TTR triggers IGF-IR nuclear translocation in cultured neurons. We could also see an enrichment of IGF-IR in the nuclear fraction, after TTR stimulation in NIH3T3 cells, indicating that IGF-IR regulation, triggered by TTR is induced by nuclear translocation. In summary, the results provide evidence of a new role of TTR as a transcription inducer of IGF-IR in central nervous system (CNS), unveiling a new role in neuroprotection.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7642055,Transthyretin and Alzheimer's disease: where in the brain?,"Transthyretin (TTR), a carrier protein for thyroxine and retinol in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), has been shown to bind the amyloid beta peptide. Accordingly, TTR has been suggested to protect against amyloid beta deposition, a key pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Supporting this view are the reduced TTR levels found in CSF of patients with AD, as well as reports of altered TTR expression in the cortex and hippocampus of AD rodent models. Importantly, early characterization of TTR distribution revealed the choroid plexus as the site of TTR synthesis within the brain. To resolve this controversy we used precise laser microdissection technology to assay for TTR mRNA expression. Our results clearly demonstrate that TTR is not produced in the brain parenchyma of wild-type mice nor in two different transgenic mouse models of AD, suggesting that contamination by choroid plexus contributed to the recent results indicating TTR production in various brain regions. The relevance of TTR to AD should now take into consideration TTR production by the choroid plexus and its ability, in the CSF, to sequester the amyloid beta peptide.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In some of them, serum reverse T3 (rT3) and thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) levels were also measured. All patients became seizure free after ACTH-Z therapy. Before ACTH-Z therapy, all of the hormone levels were within normal limits. Serum T3 and free T3 levels were markedly decreased after daily ACTH-Z therapy, and serum T4, free T4 and TBG levels were moderately decreased after the therapy. 1-6 weeks after the daily treatment, all of these hormone levels returned to pretreatment levels. Serum rT3 levels did not change after ACTH-Z therapy.

In a double-blind cross-over design, 24 healthy young men received either 300 microg of levothyroxine or placebo for two consecutive 3-week periods. Determination of thyrotropin (TSH), total triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) confirmed the induction of subclinical hyperthyroidism. Three weeks after treatment with placebo or T4, subjects were tested in two visual search tasks, one requiring the serial scanning of a stimulus array of eight items in order to detect a missing feature (serial task), while the other task allowed the parallel processing of eight items in order to detect an extra feature. Reaction times varied greatly between the tasks while no effect of T4 medication was revealed on overt search behavior. The late cognitive components of the event-related brain potentials (ERP) were registered during the tasks using a multichannel recording. The late positive component (P300) to target stimuli showed a significant reduction in amplitude in the parallel search task in hyperthyroidism, while for the serial search task a significant frontal negativity was revealed for target stimuli, both suggesting an increased effort to be exerted for the execution of visual search tasks.

AHDS is characterized by severe intellectual deficiency, neuromuscular impairment and brain hypothyroidism. In order to understand the mechanism for TH-dependent hypomyelination, we developed an mct8 mutant (mct8-/-) zebrafish model. The quantification of genetic markers for oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes revealed reduced differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes in mct8-/- larvae and adults. Live imaging of single glial cells showed that the number of oligodendrocytes and the length of their extensions are reduced, and the number of peripheral Schwann cells is increased, in mct8-/- larvae compared with wild type. Pharmacological analysis showed that TH analogs and clemastine partially rescued the hypomyelination in the CNS of mct8-/- larvae. Intriguingly, triiodothyronine (T3) treatment rescued hypomyelination in mct8-/- embryos before the maturation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), but did not affect hypomyelination in older larvae. Thus, we expressed Mct8-tagRFP in the endothelial cells of the vascular system and showed that even relatively weak mosaic expression completely rescued hypomyelination in mct8-/- larvae. These results suggest potential pharmacological treatments and BBB-targeted gene therapy that can enhance myelination in AHDS and possibly in other TH-dependent brain disorders.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

To answer this question, we used global and conditional knockouts of the TH transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), having first used FACS and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that MCT8 is the only TH transporter expressed on neuroblasts and adult slice cultures to confirm a necessary role for MCT8 in neurogenesis. Both mice with a global deletion or an adult neural stem cell-specific deletion of MCT8 showed decreased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor P27KIP1, reduced differentiation of neuroblasts, and impaired generation of new granule cell neurons, with global knockout mice also showing enhanced neuroblast proliferation.

7974213,Delivery of an anti-transthyretin Nanobody to the brain through intranasal administration reveals transthyretin expression and secretion by motor neurons,"Transthyretin (TTR) is a transport protein of retinol and thyroxine in serum and CSF, which is mainly secreted by liver and choroid plexus, and in smaller amounts in other cells throughout the body. The exact role of TTR and its specific expression in Central Nervous System (CNS) remains understudied. We investigated TTR expression and metabolism in CNS, through the intranasal and intracerebroventricular delivery of a specific anti-TTR Nanobody to the brain, unveiling Nanobody pharmacokinetics to the CNS. In TTR deficient mice, we observed that anti-TTR Nanobody was successfully distributed throughout all brain areas, and also reaching the spinal cord. In wild-type mice, a similar distribution pattern was observed. However, in areas known to be rich in TTR, reduced levels of Nanobody were found, suggesting potential target-mediated effects. Indeed, in wild-type mice, the anti-TTR Nanobody was specifically internalized in a receptor-mediated process, by neuronal-like cells, which were identified as motor neurons. Whereas in KO TTR mice Nanobody was internalized by all cells, for late lysosomal degradation. Moreover, we demonstrate that in vivo motor neurons also actively synthesize TTR. Finally, in vitro cultured primary motor neurons were also found to synthesize and secrete TTR into culture media. Thus, through a novel intranasal CNS distribution study with an anti-TTR Nanobody, we disclose a new cell type capable of synthesizing TTR, which might be important for the understanding of the physiological role of TTR, as well as in pathological conditions where TTR levels are altered in CSF, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974219,Central nervous system (CNS) delivery of glucocorticoids is fine-tuned by saturable transporters at the blood-CNS barriers and nonbarrier regions,"Proper functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis depends on the ability of glucocorticoids (GCs), mainly cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents, to access brain targets and regulate their own secretion. Being highly lipophilic, GCs have been assumed to passively diffuse through the cell membrane. However, the access of these GCs to the brain may be a more complicated process, because the free movement of molecules into the central nervous system (CNS) is restricted by the presence of the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers. GCs do interact with some transporter systems, including the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein, and members of the organic anion transporter polypeptide (oatp) family, both of which have been found at the blood-CNS barriers. Using an in situ brain/choroid plexus perfusion, P-glycoprotein was shown to not majorly regulate the access of [(3)H]cortisol and [(3)H]corticosterone to the choroid plexus or pituitary gland. Interactions of [(3)H]cortisol and [(3)H]corticosterone with saturable influx transporters were detected at the hypothalamus, cerebellum, choroid plexus, and pituitary gland. Oatp2 seems to have some role in the influx of [(3)H]cortisol and [(3)H]corticosterone to the choroid plexus and the pituitary gland and other transporters, unlikely to be oatp2, may play a very minor role in the access of [(3)H]cortisol and [(3)H]corticosterone to the brain, as well as having a significant effect on [(3)H]glucocorticoid receptor accumulation in the pituitary gland. Overall, these data suggest that the majority of cortisol and corticosterone present in the plasma diffuse into the CNS and that transporters do not play a major role in the accumulation of these GCs in the brain.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2980816,"In situ localization of transthyretin-mRNA in the adult human liver, choroid plexus and pancreatic islets and in endocrine tumours of the pancreas and gut","In situ hybridization with 35S-labeled single stranded RNA probes was used on sections from formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens to provide semiquantitative data on the occurrence of transthyretin(TTR)-mRNA in human liver, choroid plexus and pancreatic islets as well as in 15 endocrine tumours of the pancreas and gut. A monoclonal antibody to TTR was used for immunocytochemical identification of the protein in consecutive sections. The amount of TTR-mRNA in hepatocytes was found to be much less than that in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. Glucagon cells of the pancreatic islets were also specifically labeled and the level of TTR-mRNA in these cells was intermediate between that of hepatocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells. Four glucagonomas, one malignant insulinoma and two midgut carcinoids were shown to contain TTR-mRNA. The 'in situ' labeled cells were also found to be TTR immunoreactive. These findings present the first conclusive evidence for TTR synthesis in pancreatic islets and in endocrine tumours. They also establish that the high serum concentration of TTR found in some patients with endocrine tumours (notably glucagonomas) is most likely due to tumour production of TTR.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
2986890,Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a rainbow trout liver Oatp,"Cyanobacterial blooms have an impact on the aquatic ecosystem due to the production of toxins (e.g. microcystins, MCs), which constrain fish health or even cause fish death. However the toxicokinetics of the most abundant toxin, microcystin-LR (MC-LR), are not yet fully understood. To investigate the uptake mechanism, the novel Oatp1d1 in rainbow trout (rtOatp1d1) was cloned, identified and characterized. The cDNA isolated from a clone library consisted of 2772bp containing a 2115bp open reading frame coding for a 705 aa protein with an approximate molecular mass of 80kDa. This fish specific transporter belongs to the OATP1 family and has most likely evolved from a common ancestor of OATP1C1. Real time PCR analysis showed that rtOatp1d1 is predominantly expressed in the liver, followed by the brain while expression in other organs was not detectable. Transient transfection in HEK293 cells was used for further characterization. Like its human homologues OATP1A1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, rtOatp1d1 displayed multi-specific transport including endogenous and xenobiotic substrates. Kinetic analyses revealed a Km value of 13.9Î¼M and 13.4Î¼M for estrone-3-sulfate and methotrexate, respectively and a rather low affinity for taurocholate with a Km value of 103Î¼M. Furthermore, it was confirmed that rtOatp1d1 is a MC-LR transporter and therefore most likely plays a key role in the susceptibility of rainbow trout to MC intoxications.

2994720,Exposure to pyrethroids insecticides and serum levels of thyroid-related measures in pregnant women,"Possible association between environmental exposure to pyrethroid insecticides and serum thyroid-related measures was explored in 231 pregnant women of 10-12 gestational weeks recruited at a university hospital in Tokyo during 2009-2011. Serum levels of free thyroxine (fT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid biding globulin (TBG) and urinary pyrethroid insecticide metabolite (3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-PBA) were measured. Obstetrical information was obtained from medical records and dietary and lifestyle information was collected by self-administered questionnaire. Geometric mean concentration of creatinine-adjusted urinary 3-PBA was 0.363 (geometric standard deviation: 3.06) μg/g cre, which was consistent with the previously reported levels for non-exposed Japanese adult females. The range of serum fT4, TSH and TBG level was 0.83-3.41 ng/dL, 0.01-27.4 μIU/mL and 16.4-54.4 μg/mL, respectively. Multiple regression analysis was carried out by using either one of serum levels of thyroid-related measures as a dependent variable and urinary 3-PBA as well as other potential covariates (age, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, urinary iodine, smoking and drinking status) as independent variables: 3-PBA was not found as a significant predictor of serum level of thyroid-related measures. Lack of association may be due to lower pyrethroid insecticide exposure level of the present subjects. Taking the ability of pyrethroid insecticides and their metabolite to bind to nuclear thyroid hormone (TH) receptor, as well as their ability of placental transfer, into consideration, it is warranted to investigate if pyrethroid pesticides do not have any effect on TH actions in fetus brain even though maternal circulating TH level is not affected.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

We aimed to use contrast enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) to identify functional and structural alterations related to levels of NT-proBNP better to understand the mechanisms of its release in cardiac amyloidosis.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>CMR was performed on a 1.5-T scanner in 34 patients with biopsy proven amyloid light chain (AL; n = 27) or hereditary transthyretin related (TTR; n = 7) amyloidosis. NT-proBNP was higher in patients with (n = 25) compared to patients without cardiac involvement (n = 9) (2931 (IQR: 972-8629; min-max: 25-27,277) pg/ml vs. 177 (IQR: 71-1431; min-max: 22-7935) pg/ml, p = 0.008). ROC analysis identified a NT-proBNP of &lt;2426.5 pg/ml as optimal discriminator for event free survival (682 +/- 65 days).

Clinical features attributed to her leptomeningeal amyloid included radiculopathy, central hypoventilation, recurrent subarachnoid haemorrhage, depression, seizures and periods of decreased consciousness.

In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to a low concentration (0, 1, 3, and 10microg/L) of DE-71 from fertilization to 14 days thereafter. The whole-body content of thyroid hormone and transcription of genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were analyzed. Exposure to up to 10microg/L of DE-71 significantly reduced thyroxine (T4) levels and significantly upregulated the transcription of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSHbeta) genes in a concentration-dependent manner. The transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of TH proteins, sodium/iodide symporter (Slc5a5), and thyroglobulin (TG) and the transcription of marker genes associated with early thyroid development (Pax8 and Nkx2.1) were significantly upregulated upon DE-71 exposure. The expression of thyronine deiodinase (Deio1 and Deio2) mRNAs was also significantly upregulated, possibly as a compensatory response to the decreased T4 levels. However, DE-71 exposure resulted in the downregulation of transthyretin (TTR) gene transcription and did not affect the transcription of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). Exposure to DE-71 significantly induced the transcription of the uridinediphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1ab) gene.

LAT1 is highly expressed in most tumor cells and in a few normal tissues such as the bone marrow, spleen, placenta and brain. As a homolog of LAT1, we also cloned LAT2 which is expressed in various normal tissues. In order to clarify the role of LAT1 in tumor cells, we tested a relatively specific inhibitor to LAT1, BCH (2-aminobicyclo-2(2,2,1)-heptane-2-caboxylic acid), and found that BCH inhibited mortality of mice treated with sarcoma cells.

Wild-type transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is an underdiagnosed cause of HFpEF that might benefit from new specific treatments. ATTRwt can be diagnosed non-invasively by (99m)Tc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid ((99m)Tc-DPD) scintigraphy. We sought to determine the prevalence of ATTRwt among elderly patients admitted due to HFpEF.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>We prospectively screened all consecutive patients ≥60 years old admitted due to HFpEF [left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≥50%] with LV hypertrophy (≥12 mm). All eligible patients were offered a (99m)Tc-DPD scintigraphy. The study included 120 HFpEF patients (59% women, 82 ± 8 years). A total of 16 patients (13.3%; 95% confidence interval: 7.2-19.5) showed a moderate-to-severe uptake on the (99m)Tc-DPD scintigraphy. All patients with a positive scan underwent genetic testing of the TTR gene, and no mutations were found. An endomyocardial biopsy was performed in four patients, confirming ATTRwt in all cases. There were no differences in age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, or atrial fibrillation between ATTRwt patients and patients with other HFpEF forms. Although patients with ATTRwt exhibited higher median N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (6467 vs. 3173 pg/L; P = 0.019), median troponin I (0.135 vs. 0.025 µg/L; P &lt; 0.001), mean LV maximal wall thickness (17 ± 3.4 vs. 14 ± 2.5 mm; P = 0.001), rate of pericardial effusion (44 vs. 19%; P = 0.047), and rate of pacemakers (44 vs. 12%; P = 0.004), clinical overlap between ATTRwt and other HFpEF forms was high.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>ATTRwt is an underdiagnosed disease that accounts for a significant number (13%) of HFpEF cases.

Information on parents' education and habits (smoking), and on child development was recorded. Thyroid tests at each trimester of pregnancy and on cord blood (CB) were available, as well as milk concentrations of selected environmental compounds known for their neurotoxicity, including heavy metals and PCBs.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>There was no difference in Bayley tests for children born to mothers with and without iodine supplementation, but sample size was small. Language and Social-Emotional Scales were negatively correlated with TBG at all times tested, while PCB 118 correlated negatively with all Language scales. Among maternal and CB thyroid tests, only CB thyroglobulin, the best marker of iodine status, correlated (negatively) with neurodevelopment scales (Motor and Expressive Language).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>This pilot study suggests that PCB118 has a negative impact on neurocognitive development, possibly mitigating the benefit of iodine supplementation in an area of borderline ID.

3420941,Toward a better understanding of the cellular basis for cerebrospinal fluid shunt obstruction: report on the construction of a bank of explanted hydrocephalus devices,"OBJECTIVE Shunt obstruction by cells and/or tissue is the most common cause of shunt failure. Ventricular catheter obstruction alone accounts for more than 50% of shunt failures in pediatric patients. The authors sought to systematically collect explanted ventricular catheters from the Seattle Children's Hospital with a focus on elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying obstruction. METHODS In the operating room, explanted hardware was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Weekly, samples were transferred to buffer solution and stored at 4°C. After consent was obtained for their use, catheters were labeled using cell-specific markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1), and choroid plexus (transthyretin) in conjunction with a nuclear stain (Hoechst). Catheters were mounted in custom polycarbonate imaging chambers. Three-dimensional, multispectral, spinning-disk confocal microscopy was used to image catheter cerebrospinal fluid-intake holes (10× objective, 499.2-μm-thick z-stack, 2.4-μm step size, Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with motorized stage and charge-coupled device camera). Values are reported as the mean ± standard error of the mean and were compared using a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. Significance was defined at p &lt; 0.05. RESULTS Thirty-six ventricular catheters have been imaged to date, resulting in the following observations: 1) Astrocytes and microglia are the dominant cell types bound directly to catheter surfaces; 2) cellular binding to catheters is ubiquitous even if no grossly visible tissue is apparent; and 3) immunohistochemical techniques are of limited utility when a catheter has been exposed to Bugbee wire electrocautery. Statistical analysis of 24 catheters was performed, after excluding 7 catheters exposed to Bugbee wire cautery, 3 that were poorly fixed, and 2 that demonstrated pronounced autofluorescence. This analysis revealed that catheters with a microglia-dominant cellular response tended to be implanted for shorter durations (24.7 ± 6.7 days) than those with an astrocyte-dominant response (1183 ± 642 days; p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Ventricular catheter occlusion remains a significant source of shunt morbidity in the pediatric population, and given their ability to intimately associate with catheter surfaces, astrocytes and microglia appear to be critical to this pathophysiology. Microglia tend to be the dominant cell type on catheters implanted for less than 2 months, while astrocytes tend to be the most prevalent cell type on catheters implanted for longer time courses and are noted to serve as an interface for the secondary attachment of ependymal cells and choroid plexus.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7974218,Circulating microRNAs Profile in Patients With Transthyretin Variant Amyloidosis,"Transthyretin variant amyloidosis (ATTRv) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid in many organs, mostly causing a sensory-motor neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and dysautonomia. The aim of the study was to report microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profile identified in the blood of ATTRv patients. Ten ATTRv patients, 10 asymptomatic carriers of transthyretin variant (TTRv), 10 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, and 10 healthy controls were studied. Human Schwann cells cultures were used to study the regulatory effects of miR-150-5p on the expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF). ATTRv patients had 33 miRNAs up-regulated and 48 down-regulated versus healthy controls; 9 miRNAs were up-regulated and 30 down-regulated versus CMT patients; 19 miRNAs were up-regulated and 38 down-regulated versus asymptomatic TTRv carriers. Twelve out of the 19 upregulated miRNAs had a fold increase higher than 100. The validation experiment indicated miR-150-5p as a valuable biomarker to differentiate ATTRv patients from asymptomatic TTRv carriers (AUC: 0.9728; p < 0.0001). Schwann cells culture model demonstrated that miR-150-5p is a powerful negative regulator of CREB, BDNF, and NGF genes. Identification of deregulated miRNAs can help in understanding the complex pathomechamism underlying the development of ATTRv and related multisystemic pathology. Further investigations are needed on the role of circulating miR-150-5p to predict the shift of TTRv carriers from an asymptomatic status to symptoms appearance.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
384853,"Normal thermoregulatory responses to 3-iodothyronamine, trace amines and amphetamine-like psychostimulants in trace amine associated receptor 1 knockout mice","3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM) is a metabolite of thyroid hormone. It is an agonist at trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a recently identified receptor involved in monoaminergic regulation and a potential novel therapeutic target. Here, T1AM was studied using rhesus monkey TAAR1 and/or human dopamine transporter (DAT) co-transfected cells, and wild-type (WT) and TAAR1 knock-out (KO) mice. The IC(50) of T1AM competition for binding of the DAT-specific radio-ligand [(3)H]CFT was highly similar in DAT cells, WT striatal synaptosomes and KO striatal synaptosomes (0.72-0.81 muM). T1AM inhibition of 10 nM [(3)H]dopamine uptake (IC(50): WT, 1.4 +/- 0.5 muM; KO, 1.2 +/- 0.4 muM) or 50 nM [(3)H]serotonin uptake (IC(50): WT, 4.5 +/- 0.6 muM; KO, 4.7 +/- 1.1 muM) in WT and KO synaptosomes was also highly similar. Unlike other TAAR1 agonists that are DAT substrates, TAAR1 signaling in response to T1AM was not enhanced in the presence of DAT as determined by CRE-luciferase assay. In vivo, T1AM induced robust hypothermia in WT and KO mice equivalently and dose dependently (maximum change degrees Celsius: 50 mg/kg at 60 min: WT -6.0 +/- 0.4, KO -5.6 +/- 1.0; and 25 mg/kg at 30 min: WT -2.7 +/- 0.4, KO -3.0 +/- 0.2). Other TAAR1 agonists including beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and methamphetamine also induced significant, time-dependent thermoregulatory responses that were alike in WT and KO mice. Therefore, TAAR1 co-expression does not alter T1AM binding to DAT in vitro nor T1AM inhibition of [(3)H]monoamine uptake ex vivo, and TAAR1 agonist-induced thermoregulatory responses are TAAR1-independent. Accordingly, TAAR1-directed compounds will likely not affect thermoregulation nor are they likely to be cryogens.

386620,Conformational diseases: looking into the eyes,"Conformational diseases, a general term comprising more than 40 disorders are caused by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins. Improper protein folding (misfolding) as well as accrual of unfolded proteins can lead to the formation of disordered (amorphous) or ordered (amyloid fibril) aggregates. The gradual accumulation of protein aggregates and the acceleration of their formation by stress explain the characteristic late or episodic onset of the diseases. The best studied in this group are neurodegenerative diseases and amyloidosis accompanied by the deposition of a specific aggregation-prone proteins or protein fragments and formation of insoluble fibrils. Amyloidogenic protein accumulation often occurs in the brain tissues, e.g. in Alzheimer's disease with the deposition of amyloid-beta and Tau, in scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy with the accumulation of prion protein, in Parkinson's disease with the deposition of alpha-synuclein. Other examples of amyloid proteins are transthyretin, immunoglobulin light chain, gelsolin, etc. In addition to the brain, the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins leading to pathology takes place in a wide variety of organs and tissues, including different parts of the eye. The best studied ocular conformational diseases are cataract in the lens and retinitis pigmentosa in the retina, but accumulation of misfolded proteins also occurs in other parts of the eye causing various disorders. Furthermore, ocular manifestation of systemic amyloidosis often causes the deposition of amyloidogenic proteins in different ocular tissues.

Inactivating mutations in the MCT8 gene are associated with a severe syndrome of psychomotor retardation and abnormal thyroid hormone parameters.

Oatp1c1-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells transported (125)I-labeled T(4) in a time-dependent manner that was completely abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled T(4). Next, various compounds, including inhibitors of thyroid hormone uptake, were screened for inhibitory effects on Oatp1c1-mediated T(4) uptake. Phenytoin (64%), indocyanine green (17%), fenamic acid (68%), diclofenac (51%), and meclofenamic acid (33%) all reduced T(4) uptake by Oatp1c1 when assayed at concentrations of 10 microM. Dose-response assays for the fenamic acids, iopanoic acid, indocyanine green, and phenytoin revealed IC(50) values for Oatp1c1 T(4) uptake below or near the blood plasma levels after therapeutic doses. Further kinetic assays and reciprocal plot analyses demonstrated that the fenamic acid diclofenac inhibited in a competitive manner. Finally, microvessels were isolated from adult rat brain and assessed for T(4) uptake. Ten micromolar of fenamate concentrations inhibited T(4) microvessel uptake with a similar hierarchical inhibition profile [fenamic acid (43%), diclofenac (78%), and meclofenamic acid (85%)], as observed for Oatp1c1 transfected cells. Oatp1c1 is expressed luminally and abluminally in the blood-brain barrier endothelial cell, and exhibits bidirectional transport capabilities. Together, these data suggest that Oatp1c1 transports fenamates into, and perhaps across, brain barrier cells.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
3985784,"Understanding the microscopic binding mechanism of hydroxylated and sulfated polybrominated diphenyl ethers with transthyretin by molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations","Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), one typical type of persistent environmental contaminant, have toxicological effects such as disrupting thyroid homeostasis in the human body. The high binding affinities of hydroxylated metabolites of PBDEs (OH-PBDEs) with transthyretin (TTR) were considered to be one major reason for their extraordinary capacity of passing through the blood-brain barrier via competitive thyroid hormone (T4) transport protein binding. Recent findings showed that sulfated PBDEs can be formed in human liver cytosol as phase-II metabolites. However, experimentally determined data for the TTR binding potential of the sulfated PBDEs are still not available. Therefore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed in the present study to probe the molecular basis of TTR interacting with hydroxylated and sulfated PBDEs at the atomic level. The docking scores of LeDock were used to construct the structure-based predictive model. The calculated results showed that the sulfated PBDEs have stronger affinity for TTR than the corresponding OH-PBDEs. Further analysis of structural characteristics based on MD simulations indicated that upon the binding of PBDE metabolites, the stability of TTR was enhanced and the dissociation rate of the tetrameric protein structure was potentially decreased. Subsequent binding free energy calculations implied that van der Waals interactions are the dominant forces for the binding of these metabolites of PBDEs at the T4 site of TTR. The residues Ser117/Ser117' and Lys15/Lys15' were identified, by both residue energy decomposition and computational alanine-scanning mutagenesis methods, as key residues which play an important role in determining the binding orientations of the -OSO3(-) group of sulfated PBDEs by formation of either hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions, respectively. In general, the combination of docking calculations with MD simulations provided a theoretically toxicological assessment for the metabolites of PBDEs, deep insight into the recognition mechanism of TTR for these compounds, and thus more comprehensive understanding of the thyroid-related toxic effects of PBDEs as well.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
4003565,The evolutionary and integrative roles of transthyretin in thyroid hormone homeostasis,"In larger mammals, thyroid hormone-binding plasma proteins are albumin, transthyretin (TTR) and thyroxine (T4)-binding globulin. They differ characteristically in affinities and release rates for T4 and triiodothyronine (T3). Together, they form a 'buffering' system counteracting thyroid hormone permeation from aqueous to lipid phases. Evolution led to important differences in the expression pattern of these three proteins in tissues. In adult liver, TTR is only made in eutherians and herbivorous marsupials. During development, it is also made in tadpole and fish liver. More intense TTR synthesis than in liver is found in the choroid plexus of reptilians, birds and mammals, but none in the choroid plexus of amphibians and fish, i.e. species without a neocortex. All brain-made TTR is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid, where it becomes the major thyroid hormone-binding protein. During ontogeny, the maximum TTR synthesis in the choroid plexus precedes that of the growth rate of the brain and occurs during the period of maximum neuroblast replication. TTR is only one component in a network of factors determining thyroid hormone distribution. This explains why, under laboratory conditions, TTR-knockout mice show no major abnormalities. The ratio of TTR affinity for T4 over affinity for T3 is higher in eutherians than in reptiles and birds. This favors T4 transport from blood to brain providing more substrate for conversion of the biologically less active T4 into the biologically more active T3 by the tissue-specific brain deiodinases. The change in affinity of TTR during evolution involves a shortening and an increase in the hydrophilicity of the N-terminal regions of the TTR subunits. The molecular mechanism for this change is a stepwise shift of the splice site at the intron 1/exon 2 border of the TTR gene. The shift probably results from a sequence of single base mutations. Thus, TTR evolution provides an example for a molecular mechanism of positive Darwinian evolution. The amino acid sequences of fish and amphibian TTRs are very similar to those in mammals, suggesting that substantial TTR evolution occurred before the vertebrate stage. Open reading frames for TTR-like sequences already exist in Caenorhabditis elegans, yeast and Escherichia coli genomes.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
4003566,Evolution of thyroid hormone distribution,"1, Appropriate distribution of thyroxine between the lipid-soluble compartments of cells and tissues and the extracellular aqueous space is established by binding to extracellular proteins. Among these proteins, transthyretin is of particular interest because it is the only one synthesized in the brain. 2, The evolutionary onset of transthyretin synthesis in cells of the blood-brain barrier precedes that in the liver, with the exception of a very short period of transthyretin synthesis in the liver of tadpoles, just prior to the climax of metamorphosis. In adult liver, transthyretin is only synthesized in endothermic vertebrates. 3, The affinity of transthyretin for thyroxine increases and that for 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine decreases during the evolution of eutherians from reptile/bird-like common ancestors. 4, A systematic change of the N-terminal region of transthyretin occurred during evolution, leading to shorter and more hydrophilic transthyretin N termini in eutherians compared with those in reptiles and birds. 5, The molecular mechanism of the evolution of the transthyretin N termini is a stepwise shift of the splice site at the intron 1/exon 2 border in the 3' direction. The most probable cause for this shift is a series of single base mutations. 6, As the N termini are located on the surface of transthyretin near the entrance to its central channel leading to the thyroxine binding sites, it is possible that a change in the structure of this region could influence the access of thyroxine to the binding sites. The increase in affinity for thyroxine could then be a driving force in the natural selection during evolution of transthyretins with shorter and more hydrophilic N termini.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
4003672,Thyroid endocrine disruption in zebrafish larvae following exposure to hexaconazole and tebuconazole,"The widely used triazole fungicides have the potential to disrupt endocrine system, but little is known of such effects or underlying mechanisms of hexaconazole (HEX) and tebuconazole (TEB) in fish. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to various concentrations of HEX (0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/L) and TEB (1, 2 and 4 mg/L) from fertilization to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf). The whole body content of thyroid hormone and transcription of genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were analyzed. The results showed that thyroxine (T4) levels were significantly decreased, while triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were significantly increased after exposure to HEX and TEB, indicating thyroid endocrine disruption. Exposure to HEX significantly induced the transcription of all the measured genes (i.e., corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSHbeta), sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), transthyretin (TTR), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1ab), thyronine deiodinase (Dio1 and Dio2), thyroid hormone receptors (TRalpha and TRbeta) in the HPT axis, but did not affect the transcription of thyroglobulin (TG). However, TEB exposure resulted in the upregulation of all the measured genes, excepting that TG, Dio1and TRalpha had not changed significantly.

In recent years, it has attracted many attentions on account of its disturbing effects on thyroid and thyroid hormones (THs). However, the mechanisms by which the p, p'-DDE exposure influences THs still remain uncertain. To elucidate the possible mechanisms, 20 male rats are administered with different doses of p, p'-DDE (0, 20, 60, 100 mg/kg body wt) every other day by intraperitoneal injection for 10 days. The results indicate that after the p, p'-DDE exposure, serum total thyroxine (TT4) and free thyroxine (FT4) are significantly reduced and other THs changed only little. Transthyretin (TTR) declines in serum and thyroid hormone receptors (TRα1 and TRβ1) mRNA expressions elevate in hypothalamus. The hepatic enzymes CYP1A1 (EROD), CYP2B1 (PROD), and UDPGTs are significantly upregulated, but CYP1A2 (MROD) does not show significant change.

Of more than 100 TTR mutations identified, few have been associated with OLMA. Herein we describe the first report of leptomeningeal amyloidosis associated with the c.381T>G (p.Ile127Met) TTR mutation, linking this variant in the OLMA phenotype.<br /><br /><strong>CASE DESCRIPTION: </strong>A 53 year-old male presented with a 2-year history of progressive symptoms including upper and lower limb weakness, ataxia, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Neuroimaging including gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and spinal axis identified diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement along the brainstem and spinal cord plus evidence of hemosiderosis. Pathologic and genetic analyses of biopsy material from enhancing intradural extramedullary tissue at the thoracolumbar junction was diagnostic of amyloidosis of a transthyretin type secondary to a TTR c.381T>G (p.Ile127Met) mutation.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>OLMA represents a rare subtype of heritable transthyretin amyloidosis that may present with progressive neurologic decline secondary to central nervous system leptomeningeal amyloid deposition.

4190585,Importance of cysteine residues in the thyroid hormone transporter MCT8,"The thyroid hormone (TH) transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is crucial for brain development as demonstrated by the severe psychomotor retardation in patients with MCT8 mutations. MCT8 contains 10 residues of the reactive amino acid cysteine (Cys) whose functional roles were studied using the Cys-specific reagent p-chloromercurybenzenesulfonate (pCMBS) and by site-directed mutagenesis. Pretreatment of JEG3 cells with pCMBS resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease of subsequent T3 uptake. Pretreatment with dithiothreitol did not affect TH transport or its inhibition by pCMBS. However, pCMBS inhibition of MCT8 was reversed by dithiothreitol. Inhibition of MCT8 by pCMBS was prevented in the presence of T3. The single and double mutation of C481A and C497A did not affect T3 transport, but the single mutants were less sensitive and the double mutant was completely insensitive to pCMBS. Similar effects on MCT8 were obtained using HgCl2 instead of pCMBS. In conclusion, we have identified Cys481 and Cys497 in MCT8 as the residues modified by pCMBS or HgCl2. These residues are probably located at or near the substrate-recognition site in MCT8. It remains to be investigated whether MCT8 function is regulated by modification of these Cys residues under pathophysiological conditions.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

However, the effect of BPS on the thyroid endocrine system is largely unknown. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to BPS at 1, 3, 10, and 30 μg/L, from 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 168hpf. Bioconcentration of BPS and whole-body thyroid hormones (THs), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations as well as transcriptional profiling of key genes related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were examined. Chemical analysis indicated that BPS was accumulated in zebrafish larvae. Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels were significantly decreased at ≥ 10 and 30 μg/L of BPS, respectively. However, TSH concentration was significantly induced in the 10 and 30 μg/L BPS-treated groups. After exposure to BPS, the mRNA expression of corticotrophin releasing hormone (crh) and thyroglobulin (tg) genes were up-regulated at ≥10 μg/L of BPS, in a dose-response manner. The transcription of genes involved in thyroid development (pax8) and synthesis (sodium/iodide symporter, slc5a5) were also significantly increased in the 30 μg/L of BPS treatment group. Moreover, exposure to 10 μg/L or higher concentration of BPS significantly up-regulated genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism (deiodinases, dio1, dio2 and uridinediphosphate glucoronosyltransferases, ugt1ab), which might be responsible for the altered THs levels. However, the transcript of transthyretin (ttr) was significantly down-regulated at ≥ 3 μg/L of BPS, while the mRNA levels of thyroid hormone receptors (trα and trβ) and dio3 remained unchanged.

However, the effect of BPAF on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal (HPT) axis remains unknown. For elucidating the disruptive effects of BPAF on thyroid function and expression of the representative genes along the HPT axis in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, whole-body total 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (TT3), total 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (TT4), free 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (FT3) and free 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (FT4) levels were examined following 168 h post-fertilization exposure to different BPAF concentrations (0, 5, 50 and 500 μg/L). The results showed that whole-body TT3, TT4, FT3 and FT4 contents decreased significantly with the BPAF treatment, indicating an endocrine disruption of thyroid. The expression of thyroid-stimulating hormone-β and thyroglobulin genes increased after exposing to 50 μg/L BPAF in seven-day-old larvae. The expressions of thyronine deiodinases type 1, type 2 and transthyretin mRNAs were also significantly up-regulated, which were possibly associated with a deterioration of thyroid function. However, slc5a5 gene transcription was significantly down-regulated at 50 μg/L and 500 μg/L BPAF exposure. Furthermore, trα and trβ genes were down-regulated transcriptionally after BPAF exposure.

For analysis on the effects of BDE-47, TBBPA and BPA on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid genes, zebrafish embryo-larvae were acutely exposed to lethal concentrations of the chemical agents in order to determine the 96 h-LC50 (96 h lethal median concentration) and 96 h-EC50 (96 h effective median concentration) values. Further exposures at sub-lethal concentrations were then carried out and total RNA samples were extracted to quantify the mRNA expression levels of the genes of interest. In larvae, BDE-47 was found to have significantly induced many genes of interest, namely thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, thyroid receptors α and β, thyroid stimulating hormone, and transthyretin. TBBPA only significantly induced three genes of interest (thyroid receptor α, thyroid stimulating hormone, and transthyretin) while BPA only induced thyroid stimulating hormone. In embryos, BDE-47 significantly induced the sodium iodide symporter and thyroid stimulating hormone. TBBPA significantly induced thyroid receptor α and thyroid stimulating hormone, while BPA did not significantly induce any of the genes. Most genes were only induced at the 75% 96 h-LC50 or 96 h-EC50 value; however, thyroid peroxidase and thyroid stimulating hormone demonstrated upregulation in a level as little as the 10% 96 h-LC50 value.

OPFRs are used in a wide range of consumer products and have been detected in biota, including free-living avian species; however, data on toxicological and molecular effects of exposure are limited. An in vitro screening approach was used to compare concentration-dependent effects of TDCPP and TCPP on cytotoxicity and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cultured hepatocytes and neuronal cells derived from embryonic chickens. TDCPP was toxic to hepatocytes (LC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ = 60.3 ¬± 45.8ŒºM) and neuronal cells (LC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ = 28.7 ¬± 19.1ŒºM), whereas TCPP did not affect viability in either cell type up to the highest concentration administered, 300ŒºM. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed alterations in mRNA abundance of genes associated with phase I and II metabolism, the thyroid hormone (TH) pathway, lipid regulation, and growth in hepatocytes. None of the transcripts measured in neuronal cells (D2, D3, RC3, and Oct-1) varied in response to TDCPP or TCPP exposure. Exposure to ‚â• 10ŒºM TDCPP and TCPP resulted in significant upregulation of CYP2H1 (4- to 8-fold), CYP3A37 (13- to 127-fold), and UGT1A9 (3.5- to 7-fold) mRNA levels. Transthyretin was significantly downregulated more than twofold by TCPP at 100ŒºM; however, TDCPP did not alter its expression.

Hypothyroid animals were used because of the low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located.

The effects of PCP exposure on plasma thyroid hormone levels, and the expression levels of selected genes, were measured in the brain and liver. The PCP exposure at 27 mu g/L resulted in elevated plasma thyroxine concentrations in male and female zebrafish and depressed 3, 5, 3'-triiodothyronine concentrations in males only. In both sexes, PCP exposure resulted in decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone -subunit (tsh) and thyroid hormone receptor (tr) in the brain, as well as increased liver levels of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (ugt1ab) and decreased deiodinase 1 (dio1). The authors also identified several sex-specific effects of PCP exposure, including changes in mRNA levels for deiodinase 2 (dio2), cytosolic sulfotransferase (sult1 st5), and transthyretin (ttr) genes in the liver. Environmental PCP exposure also caused an increased malformation rate in offspring that received maternal exposure to PCP. The present study demonstrates that chronic exposure to environmental levels of PCP alters plasma thyroid hormone levels, as well as the expression of genes associated with thyroid hormone signaling and metabolism in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and liver, resulting in abnormal zebrafish development.

1406682,"Changes of thyroid hormone levels and related gene expression in Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) during 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole exposure and recovery","Thyroid hormones (THs) play an important role in the development and metabolism of fish through their influences on genetic transcription and are targets for endocrine disruptive agents in the aquatic environment. Amitrole is a pesticide potentially interfering with thyroid hormone regulation. In this study, the rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) was exposed to different levels of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) and allowed to recover in clean water. Plasma TH levels and the expression of TH-related genes, including transthyretin (ttr), deiodinases (d1 and d2), and the thyroid hormone receptor (tralpha) from the livers and brains were evaluated. After exposure, the plasma TH levels did not change. Histopathological observations showed that livers were degenerated at 10,000 ng/l and these damages could be recovered by the withdrawal of amitrole. However, the ttr, d1, and d2 mRNA levels in the livers of males were significantly up-regulated in all exposure groups (p&lt;0.05). The ttr and d2 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated at 10,000 ng/l and 10, 100, and 1000 ng/l in the livers of females, respectively (p&lt;0.05). In the brains of males, a twofold increase of d2 mRNA levels at &gt; or = 100 ng/l and a fivefold decrease of tralpha mRNA levels at &gt; or = 10 ng/l were observed (p&lt;0.05), whereas no significant differences were observed in the expression of d2 and tralpha in the brains of females. After a recovery period, the ttr, d1, and d2 mRNA levels in the livers of males returned to control levels, but the tralpha mRNA levels were irreversibly decreased at all treatments (p&lt;0.05). In addition, the d2 mRNA levels in the livers of females were significantly induced at &gt; or = 100 ng/l. Moreover, the d2 mRNA levels in the brains of males and females were up-regulated at 10,000 ng/l. These results indicated that amitrole exposure could result in alternations of ttr, d1, d2, and tralpha gene expression in different tissues of the rare minnow. The expression of these TH-related genes in males was more sensitive to amitrole than those of females. Recovery in clean water was associated with the selective regulation of TH-related gene transcription in the rare minnow. Therefore, these TH-related genes can serve as biomarkers to screen the effects of thyroid disruption chemicals in rare minnow.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
999286,Detection of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in herring gull (Larus argentatus) brains: effects on mRNA expression in cultured neuronal cells,"In recent years, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been detected at increasing levels in the environment due to their widespread use as flame retardants. PBDEs can affect thyroid hormone homeostasis and the cholinergic neurotransmitter system. In this study, several PBDE congeners were detected in whole brain samples and neuronal cells of herring gulls (Larus argentatus). A herring gull neuronal cell culture method was used to determine the effects of PBDEs on cytotoxicity and mRNA expression. Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed for genes associated with the thyroid hormone pathway (thyroid hormone receptors [TR alpha and beta], transthyretin [TTR]), and the cholinergic system (neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha-7 [nAChR alpha-7]). Administration of T3 resulted in a significant up-regulation of the two TRs and a significant down-regulation of TTR. TTR was also down-regulated by the commercial penta-BDE mixture, DE-71. In contrast, neither DE-71, nor BDE-47, -99, or -100 altered the mRNA levels of the TRs or nAChR alpha-7. The in vitro approach was a relevant model system for assessing the effects of PBDEs on cytotoxicity and mRNA expression.

The plasma disappearance curves of simultaneously injected [125I]T4 and [131I]albumin were analyzed to determine the rate constant for the transfer of T4 from the extracellular compartment to the rapidly exchangeable intracellular compartment (KE) and the steady state distribution ratio of T4 between the rapidly exchangeable intracellular compartment and the extracellular compartment (Imax/Emin). When rats were injected ip with EMD 21388 (2 mumol/100 g BW), the free T4 fraction in serum increased approximately 8-fold. This was due to displacement of T4 from TTR, as assessed by electrophoresis of serum proteins in the presence of [125I]T4. Concomitantly, both KE and Imax/Emin increased 6-fold in the treated rats. These results fail to confirm a major specific role for TTR in the transfer of T4 from the plasma to tissues.

1456512,Antidepressant-like effect of sodium butyrate (HDAC inhibitor) and its molecular mechanism of action in the rat hippocampus,"<strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>Epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in gene expression resulting from chromatin remodeling through histone acetylation, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. However, the antidepressant-like effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (SB) has been inconclusive. The aim of this study was to examine the antidepressant-like effect of SB and elucidate its molecular mechanisms.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>We examined the antidepressant-like effect of SB in a forced swim test (FST) and a tail suspension test (TST). Hippocampal gene expression analyses using DNA microarray and real-time PCR were undertaken. Western blotting and ChIP assay were undertaken to examine whether histone acetylation was associated with changes in gene expression by SB.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Repeated administration of SB significantly reduced immobility on the FST and the TST, and significantly altered the levels of mRNA for several genes; e.g., upregulation of transthyretin (Ttr) and downregulation of serotonin 2A receptor (Htr2a). Western blotting and ChIP assay revealed selective increases in histone H4 acetylation at the promoter of the Ttr gene with a significant increase in Ttr immunoreactivity 24 h after the final administration of SB.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>These findings suggest the possibility that alterations in gene expression, including upregulation of Ttr and downregulation of several other genes, including Htr2a, may be involved in antidepressant-like effect of SB.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
1511056,Upregulation of the heteromeric y⁺LAT2 transporter contributes to ammonia-induced increase of arginine uptake in rat cerebral cortical astrocytes,"Increased l-Arg (Arg) uptake to astrocytes and neurons is thought to contribute to enhanced nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and oxidative/nitrosative stress associated with hyperammonemia (HA). Recently we had shown that HA increases the expression in the brain of y(+)LAT2, an isoform of the y(+)L heteromeric transporter which promotes [(3)H]Arg efflux form brain cells in the presence of l-glutamine (Gln) (Zielińska et al., 2011). In this study, we demonstrate that a significant proportion of [(3)H]Arg uptake to cultured cortical astrocytes is likewise mediated by system y(+)L, in addition to the uptake showing characteristics of systems y(+), B(0+) and b(0+). However, stimulation of [(3)H]Arg uptake by treatment with 5mM ammonium chloride (&quot;ammonia&quot;) for 48 h could be solely ascribed to the y(+)L-mediated component of the uptake. Ammonia treatment increased the expression of the brain specific y(+)L isoform, y(+)LAT2, both at the mRNA and protein level, and silencing of the Slc7a6 gene coding for y(+)LAT2 protein specifically reduced the ammonia-induced [(3)H]Arg uptake. This study suggests an important role of y(+)LAT2 in the modulation of NO synthesis in the ammonia-exposed astrocytes.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Here, we tested the hypothesis that ammonia induces changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability by a mechanism coupled to oxidative/nitrosative stress (ONS) evoked in the BBB-forming cerebral capillary endothelial cells. Treatment of a rat brain endothelial cell line with ammonia (5 mmol/L, 24 h) caused accumulation of ONS markers: reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and peroxidation products of phospholipid-bound arachidonic acid, F2-isoprostanes. Concurrently, ammonia increased the activity of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2/MMP-9), increased cell permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (40 kDa), and increased the expression of y+LAT2, a transporter that mediates the uptake to the cells of the nitric oxide precursor, arginine. The increase of cell permeability was ameliorated upon co-treatment with a MMP inhibitor, SB-3CT and with an antioxidant, glutathione diethyl ester, which also reduced F2-isoprostanes. Ammonia-induced ONS was attenuated by cytoprotective agents l-ornithine, phenylbutyrate, and their conjugate l-ornithine phenylbutyrate, an ammonia-trapping drug used to treat hyperammonemia. The results support the concept that ONS and ONS-related activation of MMPs in cerebral capillary endothelial cells contribute to the alterations in BBB permeability and to the vasogenic component of cerebral edema associated with acute liver failure.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Unclear_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
1611888,Thyroid hormone transport in developing brain,"<strong>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: </strong>To discuss the recent advances on thyroid hormone transport in the brain. A special attention is paid to the X-linked thyroid hormone cell transport (THCT) defect (also known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome), caused by mutations of the specific thyroid hormone transporter MCT8 gene.<br /><br /><strong>RECENT FINDINGS: </strong>MCT8 is involved in thyroid hormone transport in the brain. MRI of patients with THCT defect showed myelination delays, probably related to impaired thyroid hormone action on oligodendrocytes. MCT8 is also expressed in the thyroid and has an important role in thyroid hormone secretion. The altered circulating concentrations of thyroid hormone in the patients are partly because of impaired secretion and altered peripheral metabolism. Increased deiodinase activity is important in the pathophysiology of the syndrome. High D1 activity in liver and kidney increases T4 and rT3 deiodination, and contributes to the increased serum T3. High D2 activity in the brain contributes to compensate the deficient T3 transport by increasing local T3 production.<br /><br /><strong>SUMMARY: </strong>Patients with suspected X-linked leukoencephalopathy should be screened for MCT8 gene mutations. Research on the brain pathophysiology of the THCT defect should focus on the specific role of Mct8 on oligodendrocytes and myelination.",t1,No_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
17876,Vulnerability of the developing brain to thyroid abnormalities: Environmental insults to the thyroid system,"Neurologic development follows orderly patterns that can be severely disturbed when thyroid hormones are deficient or excessive. Should this occur at appropriate development periods, irreversible neurologic damage can result. The nature of the deficits depends upon the specific development period and the severity of the thyroid disturbance. PCBs and dioxins are structurally similar to the thyroid hormones. Their binding characteristics are similar to those of thyroid hormones and all three groups bind to the cystolic Ah receptor, the thyroid hormone receptor and the serum thyroid hormone binding protein transthyretin. Depending upon the dose of toxin and the congener used, the toxins either decrease or mimic the biological action of the thyroid hormones. Either effect, if occurring during brain development, can have disastrous consequences. Children and animals exposed to PCBs or dioxins in utero and/or as infants can exhibit varying degrees of behavioral disorders. These disorders resemble those seen in children exposed to thyroid hormone deficiencies in utero and/or in infancy. The mechanism of developmental neurotoxicity of PCBs and dioxins is not known but data suggest it could be partially or entirely mediated by alterations in availability and action of thyroid hormones during neurological development. It is possible that transient exposure of the mother to doses of toxins presently considered nontoxic to the mother could have an impact upon fetal or perinatal neurological development. If the toxins act via their effect on thyroid hormone action, it is possible that doses of toxins that would normally not alter fetal development, could become deleterious if superimposed on a pre-existing maternal/or fetal thyroid disorder.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

T4 physiologically helps oligodendrocyte precursor cells to turn into myelinating oligodendrocytes, enhancing remyelination after myelin sheet damage. We investigated post-translational oxidative modifications of serum and CSF TTR in multiple sclerosis subjects, highlighting high levels of S-sulfhydration and S-sulfonation of cysteine in position ten only in the cerebral TTR, which correlate with an anomalous TTR protein folding as well as with disease duration.

188617,[Genetic factors for cerebral amyloid angiopathy],"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is cerebrovascular amyloid deposition and is related to stroke and dementia. CAA is classified into 6 types according to the biochemical properties of amyloid proteins, and among 6 types, the sporadic CAA of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) type is most frequently found in elderly people or patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In sporadic CAA of the Abeta type, the epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene is associated with increased vascular Abeta deposition, while the epsilon2 allele is associated with CAA-related intracerebral hemorrhage. We have also reported that the genetic polymorphisms of presenilin-1, neprilysin, transforming growth factor beta-1, and alpha1-antichymotrypsin are associated with CAA. In the case of hereditary CAA of the Abeta type, mutations in the genes of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins have been reported. Interestingly, the missense mutations associated with CAA are located in the middle portion of Abeta, while those associated with familial AD (FAD) are near the N- or C- terminals of Abeta. Individuals with FAD with APP duplication have been reported to present with severe CAA. Some of the FAD patients with mutations in the presenilin genes and patients with Down syndrome also show CAA as a complication. Besides sporadic or hereditary CAA of the Abeta type, hereditary CAA with cerebrovascular deposition of cystatin C, transthyretin, gelsolin, prion protein, and ABri/ADan have also been reported in association with mutations in the genes of the precursor proteins. Better understanding of the genetic factors influencing CAA will lead to identification of novel diagnostic markers and the development of preventive for CAA and CAA-related disorders.

1414113,Primary culture of choroidal epithelial cells: characterization of an in vitro model of blood-CSF barrier,"A primary rat choroidal epithelial cell culture system was developed to investigate mechanisms of heavy metal toxicity on the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. Epithelial cells were dissociated from choroidal tissue by pronase digestion and cultured in standard DMEM culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng epithelial growth factor per ml. The procedure yielded 2-5 x 10(4) cells from pooled plexuses of three to four rats, and a viability of 77-85%. The cultures displayed a dominant polygonal type of epithelial cells, with a population doubling time of 2-3 d. The cultures were of distinct choroidal epithelial origins. For example, immunocytochemical studies using monospecific rabbit anti-rat TTR polyclonal antibody revealed a strong positive stain of transthyretin (TTR), a thyroxine transport protein exclusively produced by the choroidal epithelia. Also, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the presence of specific TTR mRNA in the cultures. The cultures were further adapted to grow on a freely permeable membrane sandwiched between two culture chambers. The formation of an impermeable confluent monolayer occurred within 5 d after seeding and was verified by the presence of a steady electrical resistance across the membrane (80 +/- 10 ohm per cm2). The epithelial barriers appeared to actively transport [125I]-thyroxine from the basal to apical chamber. These results suggest that this primary cell culture system possesses typical choroidal epithelial characteristics and appears to be a suitable model for in vitro mechanistic investigations of blood-CSF barrier.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

There were no significant changes by Ca or Mg. Other metals including Zn, Fe caused the small degree of aggregation compared to Al. Furthermore, beta 1-40 which was aggregated by aluminum was applied on cultured rat hippocampal neurons, and the characteristic deposition of amyloid fibrils was observed on cultured neurons.

1413817,Isolation of a multispecific organic anion and cardiac glycoside transporter from rat brain,"A novel multispecific organic anion transporting polypeptide (oatp2) has been isolated from rat brain. The cloned cDNA contains 3,640 bp. The coding region extends over 1,983 nucleotides, thus encoding a polypeptide of 661 amino acids. Oatp2 is homologous to other members of the oatp gene family of membrane transporters with 12 predicted transmembrane domains, five potential glycosylation, and six potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. In functional expression studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes, oatp2 mediated uptake of the bile acids taurocholate (Km approximately 35 microM) and cholate (Km approximately 46 microM), the estrogen conjugates 17beta-estradiol-glucuronide (Km approximately 3 microM) and estrone-3-sulfate (Km approximately 11 microM), and the cardiac gylcosides ouabain (Km approximately 470 microM) and digoxin (Km approximately 0.24 microM). Although most of the tested compounds are common substrates of several oatp-related transporters, high-affinity uptake of digoxin is a unique feature of the newly cloned oatp2. On the basis of Northern blot analysis under high-stringency conditions, oatp2 is highly expressed in brain, liver, and kidney but not in heart, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, and testes. These results provide further support for the overall significance of oatps as a new family of multispecific organic anion transporters. They indicate that oatp2 may play an especially important role in the brain accumulation and toxicity of digoxin and in the hepatobiliary and renal excretion of cardiac glycosides from the body.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
20925,Thyroidal dysfunction and environmental chemicals -- potential impact on brain development,"Certain polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dibenzo-p-dioxins (dioxins, 2,3,7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) have been shown to have neurotoxic effects and to alter thyroid function during critical periods of thyroid hormone-dependent brain development. This has led to the suggestion that some of the neurotoxic effects of these compounds could be mediated through the thyroid system. Thyroid hormones are essential for normal brain development during a critical period beginning in utero and extending through the first 2 years postpartum. They regulate neuronal proliferation, migration, and differentiation in discrete regions of the brain during definitive time periods. Even transient disruption of this normal pattern can impair brain development. Thyroid hormones are necessary for normal cytoskeletal assembly and stability and the cytoskeletal system is essential for migration and neuronal outgrowth. In addition, they regulate development of cholinergic and dopaminergic systems serving the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Animals perinatally exposed to certain environmental organohalogens such as many of the PCBs and dioxins have abnormal thyroid function and neurologic impairment. Although there are both species and congener variabilities, most reports show exposure results in thyroid enlargement and reduced serum T(4) levels with normal T(3) levels. Initial research concentrated on studying the direct actions of xenobiotics on the thyroid; however, some of these compounds bear a structural resemblance to the natural thyroid hormones and have high affinity with thyroid hormone-binding proteins such as transthyretin. These compounds could act as agonists or antagonists for receptors of the thyroid/steroid/retinoic acid superfamily. These structurally similar organohalogens could act at multiple points to alter thyroid hormone action. The similarity of the neurologic impairment seen in thyroid disorders to that seen following PCB or dioxin exposure suggests that one mechanism of neurotoxicity of these compounds could involve interaction with the thyroid system.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
2138444,Human fetal and cord serum thyroid hormones: developmental trends and interrelationships,"Thyroid hormone is essential for fetal and neonatal development in particular of the brain, but little is known about regulation of fetal thyroid hormone levels throughout human gestation.

In cord and fetal serum, T(4), T(3), and TBG levels increase with gestation until term; TSH, FT4, T4S, and rT(3) levels increase and peak in the late second/early third trimester and then decline to term; T(4)/TBG ratios increase until late second trimester and plateau to term. Term cord sera TSH, TBG, and all iodothyronine levels, except T(3), are higher than nonpregnant women. In the third trimester, cord serum FT4, TSH, rT(3), and T4S levels are also higher than corresponding maternal levels, but T(4), T(3), and TBG levels are lower than maternal values.

2149477,Persistent organic pollutants and transthyretin-bound thyroxin in plasma of inuit women of childbearing age,"The Inuit population of Nunavik (Northern Quebec, Canada) is highly exposed to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) through their traditional diet. Some POPs, i.e., hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), pentachlorophenol (PCP), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compete with thyroxin (T4) for binding sites on transthyretin (TTR), a T4 transport protein found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. We tested the hypothesis that these TTR-binding compounds decrease circulating concentrations of T4 bound to TTR (T4-TTR) in Inuit women of reproductive age. We measured the concentration of T4-TTR in plasma samples obtained from 120 Inuit women (18-39 years old) by combining native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques. Total T4, TTR, and thyroxin-binding globulin (TBG) concentrations were also determined, while POPs levels had been previously measured. The mean T4-TTR concentration was 8.4 nmol/L (SD = 2.4) with values ranging from 2.9 to 14.4 nmol/L. Linear regression analysis revealed that TTR, TBG, and total T4 concentrations were significant predictors (p &lt; 0.002) of T4-TTR levels (total adjusted R-squared = 0.26, p &lt; 0.0001) but not levels of OH-PCBs, chlorophenols, or PFOS.

To elucidate the thyroid disruption effects of monocrotophos (MCP), an organophosphate pesticide, on male goldfish (Carassius auratus), thyroid follicle histology, plasma total T3 (TT3), total T4 (TT4), free T3 (FT3) and free T4 levels, and the mRNA expression of indices involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT axis) were examined following 21-day exposure to 0.01, 0.10 and 1.00mg/L of a 40% MCP-based pesticide. The results showed that MCP exposure induced the hyperplasia and hypertrophy of thyroid follicular epithelium and led to decreased plasma TT3 levels and TT3-to-TT4 ratios, without effect on plasma TT4 levels. Profiles of the changes in the relative abundance of deiodinase (D1, D2 and D3) transcripts were observed in the liver, brain and kidneys, during MCP exposure. An increase in the metabolism of T3, expressed as highly elevated hepatic d1 and d3 mRNA levels, might be associated with the reduction in plasma TT3 levels in both the 0.01 and 0.10mg/L groups, while in the 1.00mg/L MCP group, inhibited hepatic d2 transcripts might have also resulted in decreased TT3 levels by preventing the activation of T4 to T3. As a compensatory response to decreased T3 levels, pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone β subunit mRNA transcription was up-regulated by the MCP pesticide. Decreases in plasma FT3 levels were also correlated with the modulation of hepatic transthyretin mRNA expression. Overall, the MCP pesticide exhibited thyroid-disrupting effects via interference with the HPT axis at multiple potential sites, resulting in disturbance of TH homeostasis.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2155193,Recombinant transthyretin purification and competitive binding with organohalogen compounds in two gull species (Larus argentatus and Larus hyperboreus),"Glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) from Svalbard, Norway (marine), and herring gulls (Larus argentatus) from the Laurentian Great Lakes (freshwater) of North America are differentially exposed to persistent and bioaccumulative anthropogenic contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants and metabolic products. Such compounds can potentially perturb hormone transport via binding interactions with proteins such as transthyretin (TTR, prealbumin). In this present study, we isolated, cloned and sequenced TTR cDNA from the brain and liver of two species (herring and glaucous gull), which, to our knowledge, is the first report describing the TTR nucleic acid and amino acid sequences from any gull species. Identical TTR nucleotide and amino acid sequences were obtained from both gull species (liver and brain). Recombinant TTR (rTTR) was expressed and purified, and determined as a monomer of 18 kDa and homodimer of 36 kDa that putatively is comprised of the two protein monomers. Concentration dependent, competitive TTR-binding curves with each of the natural TTR ligands 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)) were generated as well as by treatment with a range of concentrations (10(-3)-10(5)nM) of 2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptaCB (CB187), 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromoDE (BDE47), and hydroxyl- (OH) and methoxyl (MeO)-containing analogs (i.e., 4-OH-CB187, 6-OH-BDE47, 4'-OH-BDE49, 4-MeO-CB187, and 6-MeO-BDE47). Relative to the nonsubstituted BDE47 and CB187 and their MeO-substituted analogs, the OH-substituted analogs all had lower K(i) and K(d) values, indicating greater affinity and more potent competitive binding to both T(3) and T(4). The OH-substitution position and/or the diphenyl ether substitution of the four bromine atoms resulted in more potent, greater affinity, and greater relative potency for 4'-OH-BDE49 relative to 6-OH-BDE47. CB187 was more comparable in binding potency and affinity to 4-OH-CB187, then was 6-OH-BDE47 and 4'-OH-BDE49 relative to BDE47 where the binding potency and affinity was several orders of magnitude greater for 6-OH-BDE47 and 4'-OH-BDE49. This indicated that the combination of the more thyroid hormone-like brominated diphenyl ether backbone (relative to the chlorinated biphenyl backbone), and in combination of having an OH-group, results in a more effective competitive ligand on gull TTR relative to both T(3) and T(4). Known circulating levels of 4-OH-CB187, 6-OH-BDE47, and 4'-OH-BDE49 in the plasma of free-ranging Svalbard glaucous gulls were comparable to the concentration of in vitro competitive potency of T(3) and T(4) with gull TTR. These results suggest that environmentally relevant and selected OH-containing PCB, and to a lesser extent PBDE congeners have the potential to be physiologically effective in these gull species via perturbation of T(4) and T(3) transport.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

[I-125]T4 was taken up into CSF of control rats by a relatively slow process, reaching a steady state after about 3 h. Both repeated dosing of HCB and single doses of PCP caused decreased uptake of [I-125]T4 into CSF, total brain tissue as well as specific brain structures, such as occipital cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. Although HCB-treatment caused a build-up of HCB and PCP levels in serum in brain only HCB was present in significant amounts (16% of the serum level). In CSF, both HCB and PCP concentrations were below detection levels. Separate experiments with PCP showed, however, a dose- and time-dependent uptake of PCP into CSF. The present results indicate that PCP and the parent compound HCB are able to affect brain supply of T4. This may have consequences for an adequate development of the brain or proper brain function in adults.

1412002,Disruption of thyroid hormone binding to sea bream recombinant transthyretin by ioxinyl and polybrominated diphenyl ethers,"A number of chemicals released into the environment share structural similarity to the thyroid hormones (THs), thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine (T(3)) and it is thought that they may interfere with the thyroid axis and behave as endocrine disruptors (EDs). One of the ways by which such environmental contaminants may disrupt the TH axis is by binding to TH transporter proteins. Transthyretin (TTR) is one of the thyroid hormone binding proteins responsible for TH transport in the blood. TTR forms a stable tetramer that binds both T(4) and T(3) and in fish it is principally synthesized in the liver but is also produced by the brain and intestine. In the present study, we investigate the ability of some chemicals arising from pharmaceutical, industrial or agricultural production and classified as EDs, to compete with [I(125)]-T(3) for sea bream recombinant TTR (sbrTTR). Ioxinyl, a common herbicide and several polybrominated diphenyl ethers were strong inhibitors of [I(125)]-T(3) binding to TTR and some showed even greater affinity than the natural ligand T(3).

2225872,The quantity of thyroid hormone in human milk is too low to influence plasma thyroid hormone levels in the very preterm infant,"Summary background Thyroid hormone is crucial for brain development during foetal and neonatal life. In very preterm infants, transient low levels of plasma T4 and T3 are commonly found, a phenomenon referred to as transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity. We investigated whether breast milk is a substantial resource of thyroid hormone for very preterm neonates and can alleviate transient hypothyroxinaemia. Both the influence of breast feeding on plasma thyroid hormone levels and the thyroid hormone concentration in preterm human milk were studied. methods Two groups were formed from the placebo group of a randomized thyroxine supplementation trial in infants born at < 30 weeks’ gestational age on the basis of the mean breast milk intake during the third, fourth and fifth weeks of life. One group received more than 50% breast milk (mean breast milk intake 84%, n = 32) and the other group less than 25% breast milk (mean breast milk intake 3·3%, n = 25). Plasma thyroid hormone concentrations were compared between the two groups. Breast milk was collected from mothers of infants participating in the same trial and the thyroxine concentration in breast milk was measured with RIA after extraction. results No significant differences were found between both groups in plasma concentrations of T4, free T4, T3, TSH, rT3 and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which were measured once a week. Thyroxine concentration in breast milk ranged between 0·17 µg/l and 1·83 µg/l (mean 0·83, SD 0·3 µg/l) resulting in a maximum T4 supply of 0·3 µg/kg via ingested breast milk. In formula milk, the T4 concentration was equally low. Protease treatment did not influence the measured T4 concentrations. conclusions No differences in plasma thyroid hormone between breast milk-fed and formula-fed infants were found. The amount of T4 present in human milk and formula milk is too low to alter the hypothyroxinaemic state of preterm infants.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2306676,Effect of methylmercury administration on choroid plexus function in rats,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a well-known environmental neurotoxin. The choroid plexus (CP), the main component of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB), protects the brain from xenobiotics, similar to the blood-brain barrier. Because CP is considered a critical target site of MeHg-induced neurotoxic damage, functional alterations in CP may be caused in relation to the extent of MeHg-induced brain injury. To test this hypothesis, we examined time-dependent pathological alterations in rats administered subtoxic (asymptomatic group) or toxic (symptomatic group) MeHg doses for 3 weeks after the cessation of MeHg administration. We primarily assessed (1) mercury concentrations in the brain, CSF, and plasma; (2) histopathological changes in the brain; (3) albumin CSF/plasma concentration quotient (Q(alb)), an index of BCSFB dysfunction; and (4) concentration of CSF transthyretin (TTR), which is primarily produced in CP. Mercury concentrations in the brain, CSF, and plasma decreased, and Q(alb) and CSF TTR concentrations did not change significantly in the asymptomatic group. In the symptomatic group, brain and CSF mercury concentrations did not decrease for 2 weeks after the cessation of MeHg administration, but no pathological alteration occurred in the brain during this period. Pathological changes in the cerebellum became evident 3 weeks after the cessation of MeHg administration. Furthermore, Q(alb) continued to increase after the cessation of MeHg administration, whereas no decrease in CSF TTR concentration was observed, indicating selective impairment of CP function. These findings suggest that MeHg at toxic doses causes selective functional alteration of CP before leading to pathological alterations in the brain.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
2308131,The methylmercury-L-cysteine conjugate is a substrate for the L-type large neutral amino acid transporter,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxin. The mechanism(s) that governs MeHg transport across the blood-brain barrier and other biological membranes remains unclear. This study addressed the role of the L-type large neutral amino acid transporter, LAT1, in MeHg transport. Studies were carried out in CHO-k1 cells. Over-expression of LAT1 in these cells was associated with enhanced uptake of [(14)C]-MeHg when treated with L-cysteine, but not with the D-cysteine conjugate. In the presence of excess L-methionine, a substrate for LAT1, L-cysteine-conjugated [(14)C]-MeHg uptake was significantly attenuated. Treatment of LAT-1 over-expressing CHO-k1 cells with L-cysteine-conjugated MeHg was also associated with increased leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into the media as well as reduced cell viability measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay. In contrast, knock-down of LAT1 decreased the uptake of l-cysteine-conjugated MeHg and attenuated the effects of MeHg on lactate dehydrogenase leakage and CHO-k1 cell viability. These results indicate that the MeHg-L-cysteine conjugate is a substrate for the neutral amino acid transporter, LAT1, which actively transports MeHg across membranes.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Serum samples were collected in the morning (08-10 am) day 1 and day 4 after sTBI for analysis of cortisol, growth hormone (GH), prolactin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (men). Serum for cortisol and GH was also obtained in the evening (17-19 pm) at day 1 and day 4. The first CT of the brain was classified according to Marshall. Independent staff evaluated outcome at 3 months using GOS-E.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Profound changes were found for most pituitary-dependent hormones in the acute phase after sTBI, i.e. low levels of thyroid hormones, strong suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis and increased levels of prolactin. The main findings of this study were: 1) A large proportion (54% day 1 and 70% day 4) of the patients showed morning s-cortisol levels below the proposed cut-off levels for critical illness related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI), i.e. &lt;276 nmol/L (=10 ug/dL), 2) Low s-cortisol was not associated with higher mortality or worse outcome at 3 months, 3) There was a significant association between early (day 1) and strong suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis and improved survival and favorable functional outcome 3 months after sTBI, 4) Significantly lower levels of fT3 and TSH at day 4 in patients with a poor outcome at 3 months. 5) A higher Marshall CT score was associated with higher day 1 LH/FSH- and lower day 4 TSH levels 6) In general no significant correlation between GCS, ICP or CPP and hormone levels were detected. Only ICPmax and LH day 1 in men was significantly correlated.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Profound dynamic changes in hormone levels are found in the acute phase of sTBI. This is consistent with previous findings in different groups of critically ill patients, most of which are likely to be attributed to physiological adaptation to acute illness. Low cortisol levels were a common finding, and not associated with unfavorable outcome. A retained ability to a dynamic hormonal response, i.e. fast and strong suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis (day 1) and ability to restore activity in the pituitary-thyroid axis (day 4) was associated with less severe injury according to CT-findings and favorable outcome.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
2750005,A marker for primary choroid plexus neoplasms,"Primary choroid plexus (CP) tumors are rare neoplasms that present in childhood or, less frequently, in adult life. The majority are benign and amenable to complete surgical excision, but occasionally more invasive variants are encountered. Although generally pathologically distinct, occasionally primary CP neoplasms may be difficult to distinguish from metastatic papillary carcinomas or papillary ependymomas. Conventional cytologic markers are not sufficiently specific to permit accurate diagnosis of primary CP tumors. The authors have reported that the CP is the unique site of synthesis within the brain of transthyretin (TTR, prealbumin), a transport protein for thyroxine and retinol. They therefore investigated the utility of TTR as a biochemical marker for CP tumors. They detected intense immunoreactivity for TTR at high dilutions of primary antiserum in the neoplastic epithelium of all of nine primary CP tumors (six papillomas and three carcinomas), but not in eight cellular or three papillary intracerebral ependymomas, meningiomas, oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, primary extracerebral papillary carcinomas (three thyroid, two breast) or five of six cerebral metastases from systemic papillary carcinomas. In one case of cerebral metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma, rare isolated immunoreactive cells were observed. Faint staining of the stromal-ependymal junction was seen in myxopapillary ependymomas of the filum terminale, which were otherwise nonreactive. By in situ hybridization, TTR mRNA was abundant in neoplastic CP epithelium, confirming local TTR synthesis. The authors conclude that TTR is synthesized by neoplastic CP epithelium and is an excellent marker for primary CP neoplasms.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Unclear_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2797981,Mass spectrometric analysis of rat cerebrospinal fluid proteins following exposure to the neurotoxicant carbonyl sulfide,"RATIONALE: Using a proteomic-based approach we have investigated possible altered expression of a range of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) proteins following exposure to the neurotoxicant carbonyl sulfide (COS). CSF is ideal for the investigation of markers of brain injury or disease since it is secreted from several central nervous system structures and changes in the CSF composition may reflect brain insult and many pathological processes. METHODS: Animals were placed in exposure chambers and were exposed to 0 ppm or 500 ppm COS for 1, 2 or 3 days, 6 h per day. After the last inhalation exposure, 50-70 μL CSF sample was obtained by lumbar puncture. CSF samples were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) on either a Premier quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) or an Agilent 6340 ion trap and by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS on a 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF analyzer. RESULTS: The dynamic range of abundance of the identified proteins spanned over more than three orders of magnitude. The four most abundant proteins identified (albumin, cystatin C, serotransferrin, transthyretin) are major proteins that are present in both CSF and blood at high levels but the fifth most abundant protein identified (prostaglandin H2D isomerase) is the second most abundant protein in human CSF and is secreted and synthesized in the rat central nervous system. No significant differences were observed between COS-treated CSF samples and the control CSF samples because of blood contamination. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative MS protein analyses of rat CSF is limited by the low sample volumes that can practicably be obtained from rats and the low protein concentrations in rat CSF. Results of this work suggest a clear need for CSF collection that would minimize blood contamination. Published in 2014.

2831493,Comparative evaluation of transport mechanisms of trans-1-amino-3-[F-18]fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid and L-[methyl-C-11]methionine in human glioma cell lines,"Positron emission tomography (PET) with amino acid tracers is useful for the visualization and assessment of therapeutic effects on gliomas. Our purpose is to elucidate the transport mechanisms of trans-1-amino-3-[F-18]fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid (anti-[F-18]FACBC) and L-[methyl-C-11]methionine ([C-11]Met) in normal human astrocytes (NHA), low-grade (Hs683, SW1088), and high-grade (U87MG, T98G) human glioma cell lines. Because the short half-lives of fluorine-18 and carbon-11 are inconvenient for in vitro experiments, trans-1-amino-3-fluoro[1-C-14]cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (anti-[C-14]FACBC) and L-[methyl-C-14] methionine ([C-14]Met) were used instead of the PET tracers. Time-course uptake experiments showed that uptake of anti-[C-14]FACBC was 1.4-2.6 times higher than that of [C-14] Met in NHA and low-grade glioma cells, and was almost equal to that of [C-14]Met in high-grade glioma cells. To identify the amino acid transporters (AATs) involved in the transport of anti-[C-14]FACBC and [C-14]Met, we carried out competitive inhibition experiments using synthetic/naturally-occurring amino acids as inhibitors. We found that anti-[C-14]FACBC uptake in the presence of Na+ was strongly inhibited by L-glutamine and L-serine (the substrates for ASC system AATs), whereas L-phenylalanine and 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1] heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH, the substrates for L system AATs) robustly inhibited Na+-independent anti-[C-14]FACBC uptake. Regardless of Na+, [C-14]Met uptake was inhibited strongly by L-phenylalanine and BCH. Moreover, the exchange transport activity of L-glutamine for anti-[C-14]FACBC was stronger than that of BCH in the presence of Na+, whereas that for [14C]Met was almost equal to BCH. These results demonstrate that ASC and L are important transport systems for anti-[F-18]FACBC uptake, while system L is predominantly involved in [C-11]Met transport in human astrocytes and glioma cells.

2832006,The 4F2hc/LAT1 complex transports L-DOPA across the blood-brain barrier,"L-DOPA is transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by an amino acid transporter, system L. Recently, it has been demonstrated that system L consists of two subunits, 4F2hc and either LAT1 or LAT2. 4F2hc/LAT1 and 4F2hc/LAT2 show different transport characteristics, while their distribution in the brain has not been determined. To clarify whether 4F2hc/LAT1 participates in L-DOPA transport across the BBB, we first examined the expression of 4F2hc/LAT1 in the mouse brain capillary endothelial cell line, MBEC4, as an in vitro BBB model. Northern hybridization and immunoblotting revealed that both 4F2hc and LAT1 are expressed and form a heterodimer in MBEC4 cells. To confirm whether 4F2hc/LAT1 acts as system L to transport L-DOPA, we characterized L-DOPA uptake into the cells. The uptake process was time-dependent, temperature-sensitive, and Na+-independent. Neutral amino acids with bulky side chains and a bicyclic amino acid, 2-aminobicyclo-[2,2,1]-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), inhibited L-DOPA uptake into MBEC4 cells to a great extent, while an acidic amino acid, basic amino acids, and glycine had no effect. Other neutral amino acids, such as alanine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, and threonine inhibited L-DOPA uptake by 40-70% at most. These characteristics are more compatible with those of 4F2hc/LAT1, rather than those of 4F2hc/LAT2. Finally, immunohistochemistry;with anti-LAT1 antibody demonstrated that LAT1 is predominantly expressed in the microvessels of the central nervous system. This is the first report showing that the 4F2hc/LAT1 complex participates in L-DOPA transport across the BBB. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

2902814,Thyronamines are substrates for human liver sulfotransferases,"Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), 3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led to the highest SULT activity. Activities with T0AM and T3AM were 10-fold lower, and there was no detectable activity with T2AM. Thyronamines were then tested as substrates with eight cDNA-expressed SULTs (1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1C2, 1E1, 2A1, 2B1a, and 2B1b). Expressed SULT1A3 had the greatest activity with T0AM, T1AM, and T3AM, whereas SULT1A1 showed similar activity only with T3AM. Expressed SULT1E1 had low activity with each substrate. T1AM, the most active thyronamine pharmacologically, was associated with the greatest SULT activity of the thyronamines tested in the liver pool and in both the expressed SULT1A3 and SULT1E1 preparations. Our results support the conclusion that sulfation contributes to the metabolism of thyronamines in human liver and that SULT activities may regulate the physiological effects of endogenous thyronamines.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

1406024,Disruption of the thyroid system by diethylstilbestrol and ioxynil in the sea bream (Sparus aurata),"Some environmental contaminants are thought to cause disruption of the thyroid system in vertebrates acting as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Such chemicals may affect synthesis, transport and metabolism of thyroid hormones (THs). Ioxynil (IOX) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) are potential EDCs with strong affinity in vitro for sea bream transthyretin (TTR), a TH distributor protein (THDP). The aim of the present study was to establish how such chemicals influence the thyroid axis in sea bream (Sparus aurata). DES, IOX and propilthyouracil (PTU, a goitrogen) were administered in the diet to sea bream juveniles at 1 mg/kg fish (n = 14/treatment) for 21 days. After exposure plasma TH levels, quantified by RIA, were similar to those of control fish (p &gt; 0.05) in all treatment groups. Analysis by quantitative PCR revealed that all treatments down-regulated TSH gene transcription (p &lt; 0.05) in the brain and pituitary and deiodinase II and III transcription in the brain (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, PTU caused DII up-regulation in the liver (p &lt; 0.05). Thyroid receptor beta (TRbeta) transcription was down-regulated in the pituitary by PTU (p &lt; 0.001) and DES (p &lt; 0.05). TTR plasma levels, quantified by ELISA, were elevated by all the chemicals including PTU (p &lt; 0.001) which also increased TTR gene transcription in the liver (p &lt; 0.05). Thyroid histology indicated follicular hyperstimulation in all treatments with marked hyperplasia, hypertrophy and colloid depletion in the PTU group. It appears therefore, that in vitro TTR-binders, IOX and DES, can strongly influence several components of the fish thyroid system in vivo but that the thyroid axis may have the ability to maintain or re-establish plasma TH homeostasis.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
4453850,Increased trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) expression is associated with a positive survival rate in patients with breast cancer,"<strong>PURPOSE: </strong>A correlation between breast cancer and thyroid disorders has been described in previous studies. Degraded thyroid hormones are referred to as trace amines. These endogenous amines have the ability to bind to the G-protein-coupled receptor TAAR1 (trace amine-associated receptor) and thereby activate it. TAAR1 is able to modulate the serotonergic and dopaminergic system in the brain and has so far been studied in the neurological field. The following study represents the first investigation of the regulation of TAAR1 in primary breast cancer (no metastases, M0).<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Immunohistochemical analyses were carried out to detect TAAR1 expression in formalin fixed paraffin embedded breast cancer samples. Survival times of primary breast cancer patients (M0) with and without TAAR1 expression in their tumours were compared by Kaplan-Meier curves, and correlations between ordinal variables were determined with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The investigation showed a correlation between TAAR1 expression and tumour differentiation grade. A well differentiated tumour grade (G1) was associated with higher TAAR1 expression and HER2 and HER4 positivity predicted higher TAAR1 expression. A TAAR1 overexpression (IRS ≥ 6) was associated with significantly longer overall survival (OS) (p = 0.02) than that of reduced TAAR1 expression (IRS &lt; 6) during a maximum follow-up of 14 years, demonstrating that TAAR1 has a favourable effect on OS of early breast cancer patients.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>We conclude that TAAR1 seems to be an independent predictor for breast cancer survival. Modulation of TAAR1 may represent a novel targeting strategy for breast cancer prevention and therapy.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Proteomic analysis of plasma and brain samples from early life treated animal model was performed in order to identify early biomarkers of neurodegeneration. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified four proteins in the plasma of adolescent rats that deviated from the control group. Low expression levels of transthyretin and plasma transferrin, and the absence of long-chain fatty acid transport 1 were measured. On the other hand, the same proteomic approach was done on striatum of an adult rat model of neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase and voltage-dependent anion channel were under expressed, while mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, myelin basic protein and ubiquitin-60S ribosomal protein L40 were absent in striatum of animal model compared to control group. Data show that early biomarkers for the diagnosis of neurodegeneration can be obtained by proteomic analysis, starting from adolescent age and the results highlight the time frame for the onset of neurodegeneration due to early exposure to xenobiotics.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
4648361,"Methylmercury Uptake into BeWo Cells Depends on LAT2-4F2hc, a System L Amino Acid Transporter","The organic mercury compound methylmercury (MeHg) is able to target the fetal brain. However, the uptake of the toxicant into placental cells is incompletely understood. MeHg strongly binds to thiol-S containing molecules such as cysteine. This MeHg-l-cysteine exhibits some structural similarity to methionine. System L plays a crucial role in placental transport of essential amino acids such as leucine and methionine and thus has been assumed to also transport MeHg-l-cysteine across the placenta. The uptake of methylmercury and tritiated leucine and methionine into the choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo was examined using transwell assay and small interfering (si)RNA mediated gene knockdown. Upon the downregulation of large neutral amino acids transporter (LAT)2 and 4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy chain (4F2hc), respectively, the levels of [³H]leucine in BeWo cells are significantly reduced compared to controls treated with non-targeting siRNA (p < 0.05). The uptake of [³H]methionine was reduced upon LAT2 down-regulation as well as methylmercury uptake after 4F2hc silencing (p < 0.05, respectively). These findings suggest an important role of system L in the placental uptake of the metal. Comparing the cellular accumulation of mercury, leucine, and methionine, it can be assumed that (1) MeHg is transported through system L amino acid transporters and (2) system L is responsible for the uptake of amino acids and MeHg primarily at the apical membrane of the trophoblast. The findings together can explain why mercury in contrast to other heavy metals such as lead or cadmium is efficiently transported to fetal blood.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The diffusion of serum proteins through the BBB was visualized with antisera to albumin, prealbumin, immunoglobulin, C1q, C3c and to fibrinogen. A similar patterns of diffusion was seen in AD/SDAT and non-demented aged individuals. Neuron and glial cells were stained with different antisera in the vicinity of the diffusion. Senile (neuritic) plaques were occasionally visualized with antisera to IgG, C1q and C3c but not with antisera to albumin, prealbumin and fibrinogen in both demented and non-demented aged individuals. Neurofibrillary tangles were not labelled with any of the antisera studied.

5975979,A new method to classify amyloid fibril proteins,"The permanganate method, the immunoperoxidase method, and a newly developed autoclave method were used to distinguish different types of amyloid fibril proteins in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. All tissues from permanganate-sensitive cases (AA type) lost the affinity of Congo red and green birefringence under polarized light after incubation with special autoclave treatment. AL type systemic amyloidosis and amyloid plaques of CJD and GSS were permanganate-resistant, but decreased markedly the affinity of Congo red after prolonged autoclaving. On the other hand, prealbumin type systemic amyloidosis and senile plaques of SDAT were resistant to both permanganate oxidation and prolonged autoclaving. Thus, amyloid plaques of CJD and GSS are identical to AL type in systemic amyloidosis, and senile plaques are similar to the prealbumin type. However, anti-prealbumin antiserum did not stain senile plaque amyloid. The anti-human P component stained positively systemic amyloids and cerebral amyloid plaques of SSE, but failed to stain senile plaques of SDAT. Therefore, the amyloid fibril protein of senile plaques is apparently different from other types of amyloid depositions. Amyloid plaques of SSE are different from senile plaques not only with regard to fibril proteins, but also to globular protein in the amyloid.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
5923143,Hypoxia affects Slc7a5 expression through HIF-2α in differentiated neuronal cells,"An imbalance of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in the brain may result in neuropathological conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders. The L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), encoded by the solute carrier transporter 7a5 (Slc7a5) gene, is critical for maintaining normal levels of BCAAs in the brain. However, our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the expression of LAT1/Slc7a5 in neurons is currently limited. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxic conditions result in upregulated expression of Slc7a5 in differentiated neuronal cells (Neuro2A cells induced to differentiate using all-trans retinoic acid). Mechanistically, hypoxia-induced expression of Slc7a5 is markedly reduced by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α), but not by shRNA targeting HIF-1α, in differentiated neuronal cells. Moreover, hypoxia increased the binding of HIF-2α to the proximal promoter of Slc7a5 in differentiated neuronal cells. These results indicate that hypoxia directly enhances the recruitment of HIF-2α to the proximal promoter of Slc7a5, resulting in its upregulated expression in differentiated neuronal cells. These findings indicate that Slc7a5 may be a novel gene responsive to hypoxia in a HIF-2α-dependent manner in differentiated neuronal cells.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
5367096,Demonstration of a coupled metabolism-efflux process at the choroid plexus as a mechanism of brain protection toward xenobiotics,"Brain homeostasis depends on the composition of both brain interstitial fluid and CSF. Whereas the former is largely controlled by the blood-brain barrier, the latter is regulated by a highly specialized blood-CSF interface, the choroid plexus epithelium, which acts either by controlling the influx of blood-borne compounds, or by clearing deleterious molecules and metabolites from CSF. To investigate mechanisms of brain protection at the choroid plexus, the blood-CSF barrier was reconstituted in vitro by culturing epithelial cells isolated from newborn rat choroid plexuses of either the fourth or the lateral ventricle. The cells grown in primary culture on semipermeable membranes established a pure polarized monolayer displaying structural and functional barrier features, (tight junctions, high electric resistance, low permeability to paracellular markers) and maintaining tissue-specific markers (transthyretin) and specific transporters for micronutriments (amino acids, nucleosides). In particular, the high enzymatic drug metabolism capacity of choroid plexus was preserved in the in vitro blood-CSF interface. Using this model, we demonstrated that choroid plexuses can act as an absolute blood-CSF barrier toward 1-naphthol, a cytotoxic, lipophilic model compound, by a coupled metabolism-efflux mechanism. This compound was metabolized in situ via uridine diphosphate glururonosyltransferase-catalyzed conjugation, and the cellular efflux of the glucurono-conjugate was mediated by a transporter predominantly located at the basolateral, i.e., blood-facing membrane. The transport process was temperature-dependent, probenecid-sensitive, and recognized other glucuronides. Efflux of 1-naphthol metabolite was inhibited by intracellular glutathione S-conjugates. This metabolism-polarized efflux process adds a new facet to the understanding of the protective functions of choroid plexuses.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
5921565,"Identification of human, rat and mouse hydrolyzing enzymes bioconverting amino acid ester prodrug of ketoprofen","Alkyl ester prodrugs are well known to be bioconverted by carboxylesterases, particularly in rodents' by first-pass metabolism in the systemic circulation and liver. However, the bioconversion of structurally more complex esters with polar functional groups is less well understood, especially in humans. Therefore, it is not clear if ester prodrugs can be utilized for targeted drug delivery. In the present study a brain-targeted ester prodrug (1) of ketoprofen, utilizing the l-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) was prepared and the enzymes involved in its metabolism in human plasma and liver S9 subcellular fraction as well as rat brain S9 fraction were identified. Furthermore, species differences among mouse, rat and human plasma and liver S9 fraction were compared. The results showed that bioconversion of the ester prodrug was much faster in mouse plasma compared to human, while it's half-life in rat plasma was closer to the one of human. Moreover, both rodent species showed more efficient bioconversion in the liver S9 fractions compared to human and relatively efficient bioconversion in the brain S9 fractions. More specifically, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and paraoxygenase 1 (PON1) were the main hydrolyzing enzymes of the prodrug 1 in human plasma, while carboxylesterases 1 and 2 (CES1 and CES2) as well as PONs were the main bioconverting enzymes in human liver S9 fractions.

5919730,Binding of iodinated contrast media (ICM) and their transformation products with hormone receptors: Are ICM the new EDCs?,"Iodinated contrast media (ICM) have been detected at high concentrations (as high as about 3 μg/L) in surface water systems, and recently in fish brains and gonad. The mismatch between the polarity of ICM and the high lipid content of brain raises questions on whether their bioaccumulation is receptor-mediated. Furthermore, the structural similarity of ICM to the natural thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine suggest potential binding of ICM to nuclear receptors in the endocrine system. Therefore, an in silico approach based on Surflex-Dock module of SYBYL was used to investigate the molecular docking of selected ICM (diatrizoic acid, iohexol, iopamidol, and iopromide). These ICM showed interaction with nuclear receptors that play key roles in endocrine regulation, including the androgen and estrogen receptors. Furthermore, the results indicate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) as one of the viable targets in the endocrine disrupting potential of ICM with higher Cscores for the ICM and iopromide transformation products than the reference ligand for the receptor. The data obtained from in silico calculations showed stronger binding of iohexol to the transthyretin-binding pocket compared to the natural hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine, suggesting the potential of ICM to act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the environment.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1

Genetically engineered defect of the Mct8 gene in mice leads to similar thyroid hormone abnormalities but no obvious impairment of brain development or function. In this work we studied the relative role of the blood-brain barrier and the neuronal plasma cell membrane in the restricted access of T-3 to the target neurons. To this end we compared the effects of low doses of T-4 and T-3 on cerebellar structure and gene expression in wild-type (Wt) and Mct8 null male mice [Mct8-/y, knockout (KO)] made hypothyroid during the neonatal period. We found that compared with Wt animals, T-4 was considerably more potent than T-3 in the Mct8KO mice, indicating a restricted access of T-3, but not T-4, to neurons after systemic administration in vivo. In contrast, T-3 action in cultured cerebellar neurons was similar in Wt cells as in Mct8KO cells. The results suggest that the main restriction for T-3 entry into the neural target cells of the mouse deficient in Mct8 is at the blood-brain barrier.

In vitro transport studies using human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing mouse Oatp1a4 identified the following compounds as Oatp1a4 substrates: pitavastatin (K(m) = 8.3 microM), rosuvastatin (K(m) = 12 microM), pravastatin, taurocholate (K(m) = 40 microM), digoxin, ochratoxin A, and [d-penicillamine(2,5)]-enkephalin. Double immunohistochemical staining of Oatp1a4 with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or glial fibrillary acidic protein demonstrated that Oatp1a4 signals colocalized with P-gp signals partly but not with glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting that Oatp1a4 is expressed in both the luminal and the abluminal membranes of mouse brain capillary endothelial cells. The brain-to-blood transport of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and taurocholate after microinjection into the cerebral cortex was significantly decreased in Oatp1a4(-/-) mice compared with that in wild-type mice. The blood-to-brain transport of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, taurocholate, and ochratoxin A, determined by in situ brain perfusion, was significantly lower in Oatp1a4(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice, whereas transport of pravastatin and [D-penicillamine(2,5)]-enkephalin was unchanged. The blood-to-brain transport of digoxin was significantly lower in Oatp1a4(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice only when P-gp was inhibited by N-(4-[2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-isoquinolinyl)ethyl]-phenyl)-9,10-dihydro-5-methoxy-9-oxo-4-acridine carboxamide (GF120918). Taken together, these results show that Oatp1a4 can mediate the brain-to-blood and blood-to-brain transport of its substrate drugs across the blood-brain barrier. The brain-to-plasma ratio of taurocholate, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin was close to the capillary volume in wild-type mice, and it was not affected by Oatp1a4 dysfunction.

8141422,Thyroid hormone transporters [Review],"Thyroid hormone is essential for the development of the brain and the nervous system. Cellular entry is required for conversion of thyroid hormones by the intracellular deiodinases and for binding of T-3 to its nuclear receptors. Several transporters capable of thyroid hormone transport have been identified. Functional expression studies using Xenopus laevis oocytes have so far identified two categories of transporters involved in thyroid hormone uptake (i.e., organic anion transporters and amino acid transporters). Among the organic anion transporters, both Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) and various members of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family mediate transport of iodothyronines. Because iodothyronines are a particular class of amino acids derived from tyrosine residues, it is no surprise that some amino acid transporters have been shown to be involved in thyroid hormone transport. We have characterized monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) as a very active and specific thyroid hormone transporter, the gene of which is located on the X chromosome. MCT8 is highly expressed in liver and brain but is also widely distributed in other tissues. MCT8 shows 50% amino acid identity with a system T amino acid transporter 1 (TAT1). TAT1, also called MCT10, has been characterized to transport aromatic amino acids but no iodothyronines.

7980899,A Novel Pathway Regulates Thyroid Hormone Availability in Rat and Human Hypothalamic Neurosecretory Neurons,"Hypothalamic neurosecretory systems are fundamental regulatory circuits influenced by thyroid hormone. Monocarboxylate-transporter-8 (MCT8)-mediated uptake of thyroid hormone followed by type 3 deiodinase (D3)-catalyzed inactivation represent limiting regulatory factors of neuronal T3 availability. In the present study we addressed the localization and subcellular distribution of D3 and MCT8 in neurosecretory neurons and addressed D3 function in their axons. Intense D3-immunoreactivity was observed in axon varicosities in the external zone of the rat median eminence and the neurohaemal zone of the human infundibulum containing axon terminals of hypophysiotropic parvocellular neurons. Immuno-electronmicroscopy localized D3 to dense-core vesicles in hypophysiotropic axon varicosities. N-STORM-superresolution-microscopy detected the active center containing C-terminus of D3 at the outer surface of these organelles. Double-labeling immunofluorescent confocal microscopy revealed that D3 is present in the majority of GnRH, CRH and GHRH axons but only in a minority of TRH axons, while absent from somatostatin-containing neurons. Bimolecular-Fluorescence-Complementation identified D3 homodimers, a prerequisite for D3 activity, in processes of GT1-7 cells. Furthermore, T3-inducible D3 catalytic activity was detected in the rat median eminence. Triple-labeling immunofluorescence and immuno-electronmicroscopy revealed the presence of MCT8 on the surface of the vast majority of all types of hypophysiotropic terminals. The presence of MCT8 was also demonstrated on the axon terminals in the neurohaemal zone of the human infundibulum. The unexpected role of hypophysiotropic axons in fine-tuned regulation of T3 availability in these cells via MCT8-mediated transport and D3-catalyzed inactivation may represent a novel regulatory core mechanism for metabolism, growth, stress and reproduction in rodents and humans.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1279126,Waterborne exposure to PFOS causes disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in zebrafish larvae,"Thyroid hormones (THs) play an important role in the normal development and physiological functions in fish. Environmental chemicals may adversely affect thyroid function by disturbing gene transcription. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a persistent compound, is widely distributed in the aquatic environment and wildlife. In the present study, we investigated whether PFOS could disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to various concentrations of PFOS (0, 100, 200 and 400 microgL(-1)) and gene expression patterns were examined 15d post-fertilization. The expression of several genes in the HPT system, i.e., corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), thyroglobulin (TG), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), transthyretin (TTR), iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1 and Dio2) and thyroid receptor (TRalpha and TRbeta), was quantitatively measured using real-time PCR. The gene expression levels of CRF and TSH were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, upon exposure to 200 and 400 microg L(-1) PFOS. A significant increase in NIS and Dio1 gene expression was observed at 200 microg L(-1) PFOS exposure, while TG gene expression was down-regulated at 200 and 400 microg L(-1) PFOS exposure. TTR gene expression was down-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner. Up-regulation and down-regulation of TRalpha and TRbeta gene expression, respectively, was observed upon exposure to PFOS. The whole body thyroxine (T(4)) content remained unchanged, whereas triiodothyronine (T(3)) levels were significantly increased, which could directly reflect disrupted thyroid hormone status after PFOS exposure. The overall results indicated that PFOS exposure could alter gene expression in the HPT axis and that mechanisms of disruption of thyroid status by PFOS could occur at several steps in the synthesis, regulation, and action of thyroid hormones.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7977825,Synthesis of transthyretin by the ependymal cells of the subcommissural organ,"Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein involved in the transport of thyroid hormones in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The only known source of brain-produced TTR is the choroid plexus. In the present investigation, we have identified the subcommissural organ (SCO) as a new source of brain TTR. The SCO is an ependymal gland that secretes glycoproteins into the CSF, where they aggregate to form Reissner's fibre (RF). Evidence exists that the SCO also secretes proteins that remain soluble in the CSF. To investigate the CSF-soluble compounds secreted by the SCO further, antibodies were raised against polypeptides partially purified from fetal bovine CSF. One of these antibodies (against a 14-kDa compound) reacted with secretory granules in cells of fetal and adult bovine SCO, organ-cultured bovine SCO and the choroid plexus of several mammalian species but not with RF. Western blot analyses with this antibody revealed two polypeptides of 14 kDa and 40 kDa in the bovine SCO, in the conditioned medium of SCO explants, and in fetal and adult bovine CSF. Since the monomeric and tetrameric forms of TTR migrate as bands of 14 kDa and 40 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a commercial preparation of human TTR was run, with both bands being reactive with this antibody. Bovine SCO was also shown to synthesise mRNA encoding TTR under in vivo and in vitro conditions. We conclude that the SCO synthesises TTR and secretes it into the CSF. Colocalisation studies demonstrated that the SCO possessed two populations of secretory cells, one secreting both RF glycoproteins and TTR and the other secreting only the former. TTR was also detected in the SCO of bovine embryos suggesting that this ependymal gland is an important source of TTR during brain development.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

To this end, we studied the distribution of the TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1), as well as the TH-metabolizing enzymes types 2 and 3 deiodinases (DIO2 and DIO3). Paraffin-embedded human brain sections obtained from necropsies of thirteen fetuses from 14 to 38 gestational weeks were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. We found these proteins localized along radial glial cells, in brain barriers, in Cajal-Retzius cells, in migrating fibers of the brainstem and in some neurons and glial cells with particular and complex spatiotemporal patterns. Our findings point to an important role of radial glia in controlling TH delivery and metabolism and suggest two additional novel pathways for TH availability in the prenatal human brain: the outer, and the inner cerebrospinal fluid-brain barriers. Based on our data we propose a model of TH availability for neural cells in the human prenatal brain in which several cell types have the ability to autonomously control the required TH content.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7977819,Identification of inhibitors based on molecular docking: Thyroid hormone transmembrane transporter MCT8 as a target,"Aims: To identify natural inhibitors against MCT8 for Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome. Background: Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 (MCT8) is a Thyroid Hormone (TH) transporter which is highly expressed in the liver and brain. Mutations in the MCT8 gene (SLC16A2) cause a syndrome of psychomotor retardation in humans, known as Allan–Herndon–Dudley syndrome (AHDS). Currently, no treatment is available for AHDS. Therefore, there is a need to discover new inhibitors of MCT8 for treating AHDS. Objective: Considering the importance of natural compounds in drug discovery, this study aimed to identify potential natural inhibitors against MCT8. Methods: As Protein-ligand interactions play a key role in structure based drug design, this study screened 24 natural kinase inhibitors and investigated their binding affinity against MCT8 by using molecular docking. The modelled 3D structure of MCT8 docked with 24 compounds using PyRX through Autodock Vina. Drug-likeness studies were made using Swiss ADME and Lipinski’s rule of five was performed. Triac, desipramine and silychristin were used as the positive controls. Binding energies of the selected compounds were compared with that of positive controls. Result: The results showed that emodin exhibited best binding energy of −8.6 kcal/mol followed by helenaquinol, cercosporamide and resveratrol. Moreover, it was observed that emodin and helenaquinol exhibit higher binding energy than the positive controls. Cercosporamide and resveratrol exhibited higher binding energy than triac and desipramine and showed the binding energy similar to silychristin. Conclusion: This study reveals that these compounds could be promising candidates for further evaluation for AHDS prevention.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
7977816,Transcriptomics reveal an integrative role for maternal thyroid hormones during zebrafish embryogenesis,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential for embryonic brain development but the genetic mechanisms involved in the action of maternal THs (MTHs) are still largely unknown. As the basis for understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms of MTHs regulation we used an established zebrafish monocarboxylic acid transporter 8 (MCT8) knock-down model and characterised the transcriptome in 25hpf zebrafish embryos. Subsequent mapping of differentially expressed genes using Reactome pathway analysis together with in situ expression analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed the genetic networks and cells under MTHs regulation during zebrafish embryogenesis. We found 4,343 differentially expressed genes and the Reactome pathway analysis revealed that TH is involved in 1681 of these pathways. MTHs regulated the expression of core developmental pathways, such as NOTCH and WNT in a cell specific context. The cellular distribution of neural MTH-target genes demonstrated their cell specific action on neural stem cells and differentiated neuron classes. Taken together our data show that MTHs have a role in zebrafish neurogenesis and suggest they may be involved in cross talk between key pathways in neural development. Given that the observed MCT8 zebrafish knockdown phenotype resembles the symptoms in human patients with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome our data open a window into understanding the genetics of this human congenital condition.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7977814,iTRAQ-based proteomic profiling reveals protein alterations after traumatic brain injury and supports thyroxine as a potential treatment,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a primary cause of disability and death across the world. Previously, RNA analysis was widely used to study the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TBI; however, the relatively low correlation between the transcriptome and proteome revealed that RNA transcription abundance does not reliably predict protein abundance, which led to the emergence of proteomic research. In this study, an iTRAQ proteomics approach was applied to detect protein alterations after TBI on a large scale. A total of 3937 proteins were identified, and 146 proteins were significantly changed after TBI. Moreover, 23 upregulated proteins were verified by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), and fold changes in 16 proteins were consistent with iTRAQ outcomes. Transthyretin (Ttr) upregulation has been demonstrated at the transcriptional level, and this study further confirmed this at the protein level. After treatment with thyroxine (T4), which is transported by Ttr, the effects of T4 on neuronal histopathology and behavioral performance were determined in vivo (TBI + T4 group). Brain edema was alleviated, and the integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) improved. Escape latency in the Morris water maze (MWM) declined significantly compared with the group without T4 treatment. Modified neurological severity scores (mNSS) of the TBI + T4 group decreased from day 1 to day 7 post-TBI compared with the TBI + saline group. These results indicate that T4 treatment has potential to alleviate pathologic and behavioral abnormalities post-TBI. Protein alterations after T4 treatment were also detected by iTRAQ proteomics. Upregulation of proteins like Lgals3, Gfap and Apoe after TBI were reversed by T4 treatment. GO enrichment showed T4 mainly affected intermediate filament organization, cholesterol transportation and axonal regeneration. In summary, iTRAQ proteomics provides information about the impact of TBI on protein alterations and yields insight into underlying mechanisms and pathways involved in TBI and T4 treatment. Finally, Ttr and other proteins identified by iTRAQ may become potential novel treatment targets post-TBI.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7977124,Radial spoke protein 44 (human meichroacidin) is an axonemal alloantigen of sperm and cilia,"To identify novel sperm alloantigens relevant to immune infertility, sera from infertile men containing antisperm antibodies (ASA) were employed on 2-D immunoblots of human sperm proteins. An immunoreactive protein spot (MW: 44 kDa, pI: 4.5) was microsequenced and the related cDNA was cloned yielding a 309 amino acid sequence corresponding to a gene currently annotated in Genbank as TSGA2 homolog (mouse) to signify 'testis specific gene A2'. In Genbank the protein deduced from this gene is currently named human meichroacidin, an orthologue of meichroacidin previously identified in mouse spermatocytes. Human TSGA2 mapped to chromosome 21q22.3. Human meichroacidin (hMCA) contained a single potential tyrosine phosphorylation site and five casein kinase phosporylation motifs. The N-terminus contained a Membrane Occupation Recognition Nexus (MORN) motif found in the lipid kinase-phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) family and junctophilins. However hMCA lacked the characteristic kinase homology domain of PIP5K. Northern blot analysis revealed 1.5 kb hMCA transcripts in testis and trachea with lower levels in thyroid and spinal cord. A semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated occurrence of the mRNA messages in all the ciliated tissues tested with highest levels of messages in testis and trachea. Western blot analysis showed the presence of hMCA protein in brain, thyroid and trachea at the identical mass, 44 kDa, as in human testis. However, this immunoreactive pattern differed from that of sperm in which a 38 kDa form was also evident suggesting that hMCA undergoes proteolytic processing. In human testis, hMCA localized to the tails of developing spermatids and did not localize to the nucleus of either spermatocytes or spermatids. EM immunocytochemistry localized hMCA within the radial spokes of the axonemal complex of the sperm flagellum, and immunofluorescence studies revealed h-meichroacidin in the cilia of epithelial cells in the trachea and ependyma. Bioinformatic identification of orthologues of meichroacidin in several lower organisms including ciliates and flagellates suggest the protein plays a role in flagellar motility across phyla. We propose the term radial spoke protein 44 as an accurate designation, preferable to human meichroacidin because it denotes the restricted localization of the protein to the radial spokes of the axonemes of both sperm and cilia. Further, since the human gene is expressed in brain, thyroid, trachea and lung in addition to testis, we suggest that the gene name be changed from TSGA2 [testis specific gene A2] to radial spoke protein 44 [RSP44].",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7977123,Hypothalamic thyroid hormone feedback in health and disease,"The role of the human hypothalamus in the neuroendocrine response to illness has only recently begun to be explored. Extensive changes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis occur within the framework of critical illness. The best-documented change in the HPT axis is a decrease in serum concentrations of the biologically active thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). From studies in post-mortem human hypothalamus it appeared that low serum T3 and thyrotropin (TSH) during illness (nonthyroidal illness, NTI) are paralleled by decreased thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)mRNA expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), pointing to a major alteration in HPT axis setpoint regulation. A strong decrease in TRHmRNA expression is also present in the PVN of patients with major depression as well as in glucocorticoid-treated patients. By inference, hypercortisolism in hospitalized patients with severe depression or in critical illness may induce down-regulation of the HPT axis at the level of the hypothalamus. In order to start defining the determinants and mechanisms of these setpoint changes in various clinical conditions, it is important to note that an increasing number of hypothalamic proteins appears to be involved in central thyroid hormone metabolism. In recent studies, we have investigated the distribution and expression of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, type 2 and type 3 deiodinase (D2 and D3), and the thyroid hormone transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) in the human hypothalamus by a combination of immunocytochemistry, mRNA in situ hybridization and enzyme activity assays. Both D2 and D3 enzyme activities are detectable in the mediobasal hypothalamus. D2 immunoreactivity is prominent in glial cells of the infundibular nucleus/median eminence region and in tanycytes lining the third ventricle. Combined D2, D3, MCT8 or TR immunocytochemistry and TRHmRNA in situ hybridization indicates that D3, MCT8 and TRs are all expressed by TRH neurons in the PVN, whereas D2 is not. Taken together, these results suggest that the prohormone thyroxine (T4) is taken up in glial cells that convert T4 into the biologically active T3 via the enzyme D2; T3 is subsequently transported to TRH producing neurons in the PVN where it may bind to TRs and/or may be degraded into inactive iodothyronines by D3. This model for thyroid hormone action in the human hypothalamus awaits confirmation in future experimental studies.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Secondary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7977122,Intranasal delivery of Thyroid hormones in MCT8 deficiency,"Loss of function mutations in the gene encoding the thyroid hormone transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) lead to severe neurodevelopmental defects in humans associated with a specific thyroid hormone phenotype manifesting high serum 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and low thyroxine (T4) levels. Patients present a paradoxical state of peripheral hyperthyroidism and brain hypothyroidism, this last one most likely arising from impaired thyroid hormone transport across the brain barriers. The administration of thyroid hormones by delivery pathways that bypass the brain barriers, such as the intranasal delivery route, offers the possibility to improve the neurological defects of MCT8-deficient patients. In this study, the thyroid hormones T4 and T3 were administrated intranasally in different mouse models of MCT8 deficiency. We have found that, under the present formulation, intranasal administration of thyroid hormones does not increase the content of thyroid hormones in the brain and further raises the peripheral thyroid hormone levels. Our data suggests intranasal delivery of thyroid hormones is not a suitable therapeutic strategy for MCT8 deficiency, although alternative formulations could be considered in the future to improve the nose-to-brain transport.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974231,Regulation of system x(c)(-)activity and expression in astrocytes by interleukin-1β: implications for hypoxic neuronal injury,"We recently demonstrated that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) increases system x(c)(-) (cystine/glutamate antiporter) activity in mixed cortical cell cultures, resulting in an increase in hypoxic neuronal injury when glutamate clearance is impaired. Herein, we demonstrate that neurons, astrocytes, and microglia all express system x(c)(-) subunits (xCT, 4F2hc, RBAT) and are capable of cystine import. However, IL-1β stimulation increases mRNA for xCT--the light chain that confers substrate specificity--in astrocytes only; an effect blocked by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Additionally, only astrocytes show an increase in cystine uptake following IL-1β exposure; an effect associated with a change in xCT protein. The increase in cystine uptake that follows IL-1β is lacking in astrocytes derived from mice harboring a mutation in Slc7a11 (sut gene), which encodes for xCT, and in wild-type astrocytes treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. IL-1β does not regulate the light chain of the amino acid transporter, LAT2, or the expression and function of astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), demonstrating some target selectivity. Finally, the enhanced neuronal vulnerability to hypoxia that followed IL-1β treatment in our mixed culture system was not observed in chimeric cultures consisting of wild-type neurons plated on top of sut astrocytes. Nor was it observed in wild-type cultures treated with a system x(c)(-) inhibitor or an NMDA receptor antagonist. Overall, our data demonstrate that IL-1β selectively regulates system x(c)(-) activity in astrocytes and that this change is specifically responsible for the deleterious, excitotoxic effects of IL-1β found under hypoxic conditions.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7974229,Gender-specific effects of transthyretin on neural stem cell fate in the subventricular zone of the adult mouse,"Choroid plexus epithelial cells produce and secrete transthyretin (TTR). TTR binds and distributes thyroid hormone (TH) to brain cells via the cerebrospinal fluid. The adult murine subventricular zone (SVZ) is in close proximity to the choroid plexus. In the SVZ, TH determines neural stem cell (NSC) fate towards a neuronal or a glial cell. We investigated whether the loss of TTR also disrupted NSC fate choice. Our results show a decreased neurogenic versus oligodendrogenic balance in the lateroventral SVZ of Ttr knockout mice. This balance was also decreased in the dorsal SVZ, but only in Ttr knockout male mice, concomitant with an increased oligodendrocyte precursor density in the corpus callosum. Quantitative RTqPCR analysis following FACS-dissected SVZs, or marked-coupled microbeads sorting of in vitro neurospheres, showed elevated Ttr mRNA levels in neuronal cells, as compared to uncommitted precursor and glial cells. However, TTR protein was undetectable in vivo using immunostaining, and this despite the presence of Ttr mRNA-expressing SVZ cells. Altogether, our data demonstrate that TTR is an important factor in SVZ neuro- and oligodendrogenesis. They also reveal important gender-specific differences and spatial heterogeneity, providing new avenues for stimulating endogenous repair in neurodegenerative diseases.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974225,"Binding of thyroxine to pig transthyretin, its cDNA structure, and other properties","Thyroxine binding to proteins in pig plasma during electrophoresis was observed in the albumin, but not in the prealbumin and post-albumin regions. Transthyretin could be identified in medium from in vitro pig choroid plexus incubations by size and number of subunits and a very high rate of synthesis and secretion. Its electrophoretic mobility was intermediate between that of thyroxine-binding globulin and albumin. It bound thyroxine, retinol-binding protein, anti-(rat transthyretin) antibodies and behaved similarly to transthyretins from other vertebrate species when plasma was extracted with phenol. Inhibition experiments with the synthetic flavonoid F 21388, analysing the binding of thyroxine, suggested that transthyretin is not a major thyroxine carrier in the bloodstream of pigs. Cloning and sequencing of transthyretin cDNA from both choroid plexus and liver showed that the same transthyretin mRNA is expressed in pig choroid plexus and liver. The amino acid sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence revealed that pig transthyretin differs from the transthyretins of all other studied vertebrate species by an unusual C-terminal extension consisting of the amino acids glycine, alanine and leucine. This extension results from the mutation of a stop codon into a codon for glycine. The unusual C-terminal extensions do not seem to interfere with the access of thyroxine to its binding site in the central channel of transthyretin.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7974224,The role of LAT1 in (18)F-DOPA uptake in malignant gliomas,"Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the amino acid tracer 6-(18)F-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) may provide better spatial and functional information in human gliomas than CT or MRI alone. The L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is responsible for membrane transport of large neutral amino acids in normal cells. This study assessed the relationship between LAT1 expression and (18)F-DOPA uptake in human astrocytomas. Endogenous LAT1 expression was measured in established glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines and primary GBM xenografts using Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Uptake of (18)F-DOPA was approximated in vitro using (3)H-L-DOPA as an analog. Uptake of (3)H-L-DOPA was assessed in cells expressing LAT1 shRNA or LAT1 siRNA and compared to non-targeted (NT) control shRNA or siRNA sequences, respectively. To demonstrate the clinical relevance of these findings, LAT1 immunofluorescence staining was compared with corresponding regions of (18)F-DOPA PET uptake in patients with newly diagnosed astrocytomas. LAT1 mRNA and protein expression varies in GBM, and the extent of (3)H-L-DOPA uptake was positively correlated with endogenous LAT1 expression. Stable shRNA-mediated LAT1 knockdown in T98 and GBM28 reduced (3)H-L-DOPA uptake relative to NT shRNA by 57 (P < 0.0001) and 52 % (P < 0.001), respectively. Transient siRNA-mediated LAT1 knockdown in T98 reduced (3)H-L-DOPA uptake relative to NT siRNA up to 68 % (P < 0.01). In clinical samples, LAT1 expression positively correlated with (18)F-DOPA PET uptake (P = 0.04). Expression of LAT1 is strongly associated with (3)H-L-DOPA uptake in vitro and (18)F-DOPA uptake in patient biopsy samples.

A polyclonal affinity purified antibody against the N-terminus of LAT1 was generated in chickens and used in immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses of brain tissue sections of adult rats. On immunoblots, the antibody detected a peptide-inhibitable 45 kDa band in a rat brain microvessel membrane preparation. It also identified the same protein band in membrane preparations of different brain structures, as well as in heart and testis, whereas the protein was absent or only faintly detectable in muscle, kidney, and liver. In brain sections, the antibody intensely labeled the luminal and abluminal membranes of brain microvessel endothelial cells in all brain areas examined including cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and in gray and white matter regions.

7974221,Molecular analysis of the mouse brain exposed to chronic mild stress: The influence of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α on physiological homeostasis,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent disorder that causes considerable disability in social functioning and is a risk factor for physical diseases. Recent clinical reports have demonstrated a marked association between MDD and physiological dyshomeostasis induced by metabolic disorders, including diabetes, hormone abnormalities and autoimmune diseases. The authors of the present study have previously analyzed comparative gene expression profiles in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a chronic mild stress (CMS) animal model of MDD. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4α) was identified as a central regulator that exerted significant influence on genes associated with physiological homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to investigate: i) the molecular mechanism of the depressive state in the PFC, and ii) the involvement of genes extracted from the comparative gene expression profiles, particularly those applicable to MDD in clinical practice. Core analysis of the previous PFC microarray results was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Subsequently, IPA was used to search for molecules that are regulated by Hnf4α, and exist in the PFC and serum. From the core analysis, 5 genes that are associated with cell death and are expressed in the cortex were selected. Four of the extracted genes, insulin‑like growth factor 1, transthyretin, serpin family A member 3 and plasminogen, were markedly affected by Hnf4α. S100 calcium‑binding protein A9 (S100a9) and α2-HS-glycoprotein (Ahsg) were also chosen as they exist in serum and are also affected by Hnf4α. A significant group difference in the expression of these two genes was detected in the PFC, thalamus and hippocampus. The protein levels of AHSG and S100A9 in the PFC and hippocampus of the CMS group increased significantly when compared with the control group. These findings support the close association of Hnf4α (through genes such as S100a9 and Ahsg) with the development of various diseases induced by deregulation of physiological homeostasis during the progression of MDD.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
7974220,"Drug transporters are altered in brain, liver and kidney of rats with chronic epilepsy induced by lithium-pilocarpine","<strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>Pharmacoresistance is a common problem hindering treatment of epilepsy. A possible cause for this resistance is the overexpression of efflux drug transporters, e.g. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may decrease extracellular antiepileptic drugs levels in brains of intractable epilepsy patients. Another transmembrane drug transporter is the organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (Oatp2), which is colocalized with P-gp in many polarized tissues. However, a role for Oatp2 in the development of multidrug resistance has not been established. In the present work, we investigated the expression of drug transporters Oatp2 and P-gp in brain, liver and kidney of rats with chronic epilepsy induced by lithium-pilocarpine.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Chronic epilepsy was elicited after status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine in adult Wistar rats. Following SE, expression of Oatp2 and P-gp protein was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis and messenger RNA (mRNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Levels of the drug transporters were compared in brain, liver and kidney of chronic epileptic and control rats.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Both Oatp2 and P-gp were expressed in the brain, liver and kidney but predominantly in the brain. In the brain, Oatp2 and P-gp immunopositive cells were observed in brain capillary endothelium and choroid plexus epithelium. Compared with control rats, Oatp2 protein expression in brain was significantly decreased, while P-gp was obviously increased in chronic epileptic rats. P-gp mRNA was also significantly higher in brains of chronic epileptic rats, whereas the expression of Oatp2 did not change. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 and P-gp did not change at the mRNA or protein level with epilepsy in the liver or kidney.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 and P-gp colocalized in tissues that are important in drug absorption, metabolism and excretion. Seizures seem to induce the cerebral changes of P-gp and Oatp2. However, the changes of expression of two transporters exhibit the opposite trend. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 might play a different role than P-gp in intractable epilepsy.

6318075,17beta-estradiol induces transthyretin expression in murine choroid plexus via an oestrogen receptor dependent pathway,"Oestrogen protects against AD by multiple mechanisms, including the enhancement of Abeta clearance. Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric protein mainly synthesized by the liver and choroid plexus (CP) of the brain that sequesters the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. In this study we examined the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on TTR protein and mRNA levels, in primary cultures of rat CP epithelial cells (CPEC) by Western blot and Real Time PCR, respectively. Moreover, the localization of oestrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta) in response to E2 treatment was analysed by confocal microscopy in these cells. The expression of TTR, ERalpha and ERbeta was also compared in the CP of castrated female mice treated with E2 to vehicle-treated animals by Real Time PCR. TTR concentration in the CSF of all these animals was measured by radioimmunoassay. E2 treatment induced TTR transcription and increased TTR protein content in CPEC. Pre-treatment with ICI 182,780 (ICI) abrogated E2-induced TTR expression suggesting that, TTR is up-regulated via an ER-dependent pathway. Confocal microscopy demonstrated extranuclear ERalpha and ERbeta localization in untreated CPEC. Upon E2 treatment, translocation of ERalpha to the nucleus occurred, while ERbeta remained in the cytosol.

7189777,"Hit-to-Lead Optimization of Mouse Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1 (mTAAR1) Agonists with a Diphenylmethane-Scaffold: Design, Synthesis, and Biological Study","The trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) potently activated by a variety of molecules besides trace amines (TAs), including thyroid hormone-derivatives like 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), catechol-O-methyltransferase products like 3-methoxytyramine, and amphetamine-related compounds. Accordingly, TAAR1 is considered a promising target for medicinal development. To gain more insights into TAAR1 physiological functions and validation of its therapeutic potential, we recently developed a new class of thyronamine-like derivatives. Among them compound SG2 showed high affinity and potent agonist activity at mouse TAAR1. In the present work, we describe,design, synthesis, and SAR study of a new series, of compounds (1-16) obtained by introducing specific structural changes at key points of our lead compound SG2 skeleton. Five of the newly synthesized compounds displayed mTAAR1 agonist activity higher than both SG2 and T1AM.

5082341,The heterodimeric amino acid transporter 4F2hc/y(+)LAT2 mediates arginine efflux in exchange with glutamine,"The cationic amino acid arginine, due to its positive charge, is usually accumulated in the cytosol. Nevertheless, arginine has to be released by a number of cell types, e.g. kidney cells, which supply other organs with this amino acid, or the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier which release arginine into the brain. Arginine release in mammalian cells can be mediated by two different transporters, y(+)LAT1 and y(+)LAT2. For insertion into the plasma membrane, these transporters have to be associated with the type-II membrane glycoprotein 4F2hc [Torrents, Estevez, Pineda, Fernandez, Lloberas, Shi, Zorzano and Palacin (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32437-32445]. The present study elucidates the function and distribution of y(+)LAT2. In contrast to y(+)LAT1, which is expressed mainly in kidney epithelial cells, lung and leucocytes, y(+)LAT2 has a wider tissue distribution, including brain, heart, testis, kidney, small intestine and parotis. When co-expressed with 4F2hc in Xenopus laevis oocytes, y(+)LAT2 mediated uptake of arginine, leucine and glutamine. Arginine uptake was inhibited strongly by lysine, glutamate, leucine, glutamine, methionine and histidine. Mutual inhibition was observed when leucine or glutamine was used as substrate. Inhibition of arginine uptake by neutral amino acids depended on the presence of Na+, which is a hallmark of y(+)LAT-type transporters. Although arginine Transport was inhibited strongly by glutamate, this anionic amino acid was only weakly transported by 4F2hc/y(+)LAT2. Amino acid transport via 4F2hc/y(+)LAT2 followed an antiport mechanism similar to the other members of this new family. Only preloaded arginine could be released in exchange for extracellular amino acids, whereas marginal release of glutamine or leucine was observed under identical conditions. These results indicated that arginine has the highest affinity for the intracellular binding site and that arginine release may be the main physiological function of this transporter.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
4863497,Positive Regulation of Decidualization by l-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (lat1) in Pregnant Mice,"Amino acids have an important role in the pre and post implantation of placenta and embryo development. l-type amino-acid transporter 1 (lat1) is responsible for the transportation of large neutral amino acids and is mainly expressed in human fetal liver, placenta, brain, etc. This study is the first to investigate the expression of lat1 in the early pregnancy of mouse uteri and its role in the process of decidualization. Endometrial stromal cells of a mouse model were used to evaluate decidualization from Day 4-8 of pregnancy in vitro followed by lat1 knock down by small interfering RNA and by a competitive inhibitor of Leucine transport 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH). The effects of lat1 on decidualization in vivo were assessed by injecting BCH into the uterine horns. The mRNA and protein expressions of lat1 in the implantation sites were higher than that in the inter-implantation sites and were localized in the luminal and gland epithelium, stromal and decidual cells. Its increased expression (p < 0.05) was associated with artificial decidualization as well as activation of prl expression. Down-regulation of lat1 expression in these cells by siRNA and BCH inhibited the decidual progression in vitro. Inhibition of lat1 transportation by BCH controlled decidual progression in vivo also accompanied the down-regulation of prl, lat1 expression in the decidual area and embryo size on Day 8 of pregnancy. In conclusion, these results revealed that lat1 might play an important role in the decidual progression both in vitro and in vivo.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
5081426,Exposure to PFDoA causes disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in zebrafish larvae,"Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA), a kind of perfluorinated carboxylic acid (PFCA) with 12 carbon atoms, has an extensive industrial utilization and is widespread in both wildlife and the water environment, and was reported to have the potential to cause a disruption in the thyroid hormone system homeostasis. In this study, zebrafish embryos/larvae were exposed to different concentrations of PFDoA (0, 0.24, 1.2, 6 mg/L) for 96 h post-fertilization (hpf). PFDoA exposure caused obvious growth restriction connected with the reduced thyroid hormones (THs) contents in zebrafish larvae, strengthening the interference effect on the growth of fish larvae. The transcriptional level of genes within the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis was analyzed. The gene expression levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (crh) were upregulated upon exposure to 6 mg/L of PFDoA, and iodothyronine deiodinases (dio2) was upregulated in the 1.2 mg/L PFDoA group. The transcription of thyroglobulin (tg) and thyroid receptor (trβ) were significantly downregulated upon exposure to 1.2 mg/L and 6 mg/L of PFDoA. PFDoA could also decrease the levels of sodium/iodide symporter (nis) and transthyretin (ttr) gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure. A significant decrease in thyroid-stimulating hormoneβ (tshβ), uridinediphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt1ab) and thyroid receptor (trα) gene expression were observed at 6 mg/L PFDoA exposure. Upregulation and downregulation of iodothyronine deiodinases (dio1) gene expression were observed upon the treatment of 1.2 mg/L and 6 mg/L PFDoA, respectively. All the data demonstrated that gene expression in the HPT axis altered after different PFDoA treatment and the potential mechanisms of the disruption of thyroid status could occur at several steps in the process of synthesis, regulation, and action of thyroid hormones.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Methods: During fetal mice neural tube closed (pregnancy 9.5 days, E9.5d) to begin synthesis of THs (E15.5 d), all pregnant mice were administered with different concentration of DEHP (0、10、50、200 mg/kg) by gavage once a day(10 mice per group). All pregnant mice were conducted with BrdU administration in E14d by subcutaneous injection. Seven pregnant mice from each group were scarified after anesthesia in E15.5 d, serum and amniotic fluid were collected to determinate the levels of THs(T(3), T(4), FT(3) and FT(4)) by the automatic biochemical analyzer, detecting fetal mice placental protein expression of monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) and deiodinaseⅡ&Ⅲ (DIO(2), DIO(3)) by Western blot. Each group of the remaining three pregnant mices were killed after anesthesia in E18d, take the male fetal brain, BrdU immunohistochemistry was used to detect the proliferation and migration of fetal brain cortical neurons. Results: There was no abnormalities in diet, water intake, body weight and general activity of pregnant mice in each treatment group, and there were no difference in the general physiolo. Results There was no abnormalities in diet, water intake, body weight and general activity of pregnant mice in each treatment group, and there were no difference in the general physiological development status of body weight, brain weight, brain body ratio between the mice of each group. There was no statistically significant differences in serum T(3), T(4), FT(3), FT(4) and amniotic fluid FT(4) in pregnant mice of each group (P>0.05), Compared with the control group, the FT(3) levels in the amniotic fluid of the DEHP 50 and 200 mg/kg groups were significantly decreased(P<0.05).

4987041,Establishment of an in vitro brain barrier epithelial transport system for pharmacological and toxicological study,"An immortalized Z310 murine choroidal epithelial cell line was recently established in this laboratory. The purposes of this study were (1) to investigate the presence of tight junction (TJ) proteins in Z310 cells and (2) to develop a Z310 cell-based in vitro brain barrier transport model. Real-time RT-PCR studies revealed that Z310 cells possess mRNAs encoding ZO-1, -2, and -3, claudin-1, -2, -4, and -8, occludin, and connexin-32. Confocal microscopic analyses confirmed the presence of claudin-1 and ZO-1 in Z310 cells at cell-cell contact sites. When Z310 cells were grown on a two-chamber Transwell device, the [14C]sucrose permeability coefficient and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) across the cell monolayer were 6 x 10(-4) cm/min and 61 omega-cm2, respectively. To improve the tightness of Z310 barrier, the cells were cultured in astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM), or in the presence of eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA, 10 microM), epidermal growth factor (EGF, 100 ng/mL), or dexamethasone (1 microM) in the growth medium. Treatment with ACM, EPA, EGF and dexamethasone significantly increased the TEER by 33%, 38%, 40%, and 50% above controls, respectively. However, only dexamethasone significantly reduced [14C]sucrose paracellular permeability (-231% of controls). These data suggest that Z310 cells possess the TJ proteins. The presence of dexamethasone in the growth medium improves the tightness of Z310 cell monolayer to the level better than that of the primary culture of choroidal epithelial cells. The Z310 cell-based in vitro model appears to be suitable for transepithelial transport study of drugs and toxicants.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
4733892,Ammonia Reduces Intracellular Asymmetric Dimethylarginine in Cultured Astrocytes Stimulating Its y⁺LAT2 Carrier-Mediated Loss,"Previously we had shown that ammonia stimulates nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in astrocytes by increasing the uptake of the precursor amino acid, arginine via the heteromeric arginine/glutamine transporter y⁺LAT2. Ammonia also increases the concentration in the brain of the endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), but distribution of ADMA surplus between the intraastrocytic and extracellular compartments of the brain has not been studied. Here we tested the hypothesis that ammonia modulates the distribution of ADMA and its analog symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) between the two compartments of the brain by competition with arginine for the y⁺LAT2 transporter. In extension of the hypothesis we analyzed the ADMA/Arg interaction in endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier. We measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) technique the concentration of arginine, ADMA and SDMA in cultured cortical astrocytes and in a rat brain endothelial cell line (RBE-4) treated with ammonia and the effect of silencing the expression of a gene coding y⁺LAT2. We also tested the expression of ADMA metabolism enzymes: protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) and dimethylarginine dimethyl aminohydrolase (DDAH) and arginine uptake to astrocytes. Treatment for 48 h with 5 mM ammonia led to an almost 50% reduction of ADMA and SDMA concentration in both cell types, and the effect in astrocytes was substantially attenuated by silencing of the Slc7a6 gene. Moreover, the y⁺LAT2-dependent component of ammonia-evoked arginine uptake in astrocytes was reduced in the presence of ADMA in the medium. Our results suggest that increased ADMA efflux mediated by upregulated y⁺LAT2 may be a mechanism by which ammonia interferes with intra-astrocytic (and possibly intra-endothelial cell) ADMA content and subsequently, NO synthesis in both cell types.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1300760,3-Iodothyronamine is an endogenous and rapid-acting derivative of thyroid hormone,"Thyroxine (T(4)) is the predominant form of thyroid hormone (TH). Hyperthyroidism, a condition associated with excess TH, is characterized by increases in metabolic rate, core body temperature and cardiac performance. In target tissues, T(4) is enzymatically deiodinated to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)), a high-affinity ligand for the nuclear TH receptors TR alpha and TR beta, whose activation controls normal vertebrate development and physiology. T(3)-modulated transcription of target genes via activation of TR alpha and TR beta is a slow process, the effects of which manifest over hours and days. Although rapidly occurring effects of TH have been documented, the molecules that mediate these non-genomic effects remain obscure. Here we report the discovery of 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM), a naturally occurring derivative of TH that in vitro is a potent agonist of the G protein-coupled trace amine receptor TAR1. Administering T(1)AM in vivo induces profound hypothermia and bradycardia within minutes. T(1)AM treatment also rapidly reduces cardiac output in an ex vivo working heart preparation. These results suggest the existence of a new signaling pathway, stimulation of which leads to rapid physiological and behavioral consequences that are opposite those associated with excess TH.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
4955355,Role of the subcommissural organ in the pathogenesis of congenital hydrocephalus in the HTx rat,"The present investigation was designed to clarify the role of the subcommissural organ (SCO) in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus occurring in the HTx rat. The brains of non-affected and hydrocephalic HTx rats from embryonic day 15 (E15) to postnatal day 10 (PN10) were processed for electron microscopy, lectin binding and immunocytochemistry by using a series of antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of non-affected and hydrocephalic HTx rats were collected at PN1, PN7 and PN30 and analysed by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis, immunoblotting and nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS. A distinct malformation of the SCO is present as early as E15. Since stenosis of the Sylvius aqueduct (SA) occurs at E18 and dilation of the lateral ventricles starts at E19, the malformation of the SCO clearly precedes the onset of hydrocephalus. In the affected rats, the cephalic and caudal thirds of the SCO showed high secretory activity with all methods used, whereas the middle third showed no signs of secretion. At E18, the middle non-secretory third of the SCO progressively fused with the ventral wall of SA, resulting in marked aqueduct stenosis and severe hydrocephalus. The abnormal development of the SCO resulted in the permanent absence of Reissner's fibre (RF) and led to changes in the protein composition of the CSF. Since the SCO is the source of a large mass of sialilated glycoproteins that form the RF and of those that remain CSF-soluble, we hypothesize that the absence of this large mass of negatively charged molecules from the SA domain results in SA stenosis and impairs the bulk flow of CSF through the aqueduct.",t1,No_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
4824739,"Safety, efficacy and physiological actions of a lysine-free, arginine-rich formula to treat glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: Focus on cerebral amino acid influx","Striatal degeneration from glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (glutaric aciduria type 1, GA1) is associated with cerebral formation and entrapment of glutaryl-CoA and its derivatives that depend on cerebral lysine influx. In 2006 we designed a lysine-free study formula enriched with arginine to selectively block lysine transport across cerebral endothelia and thereby limit glutaryl-CoA production by brain. Between 2006 and present, we treated twelve consecutive children with study formula (LYSx group) while holding all other treatment practices constant. Clinical and biochemical outcomes were compared to 25 GA1 patients (PROx group) treated between 1995 and 2005 with natural protein restriction (dietary lysine/arginine ratio of 1.7±0.3 mg:mg). We used published kinetic parameters of the y+and LAT1 blood-brain barrier transporters to model the influx of amino acids into the brain. Arginine fortification to achieve a mean dietary lysine/arginine ratio of 0.7±0.2 mg:mg was neuroprotective. All 12 LYSx patients are physically and neurologically healthy after 28 aggregate patient-years of follow up (current ages 28±21 months) and there were no adverse events related to formula use. This represents a 36% reduction of neurological risk (95% confidence interval 14-52%, p=0.018) that we can directly attribute to altered amino acid intake. During the first year of life, 20% lower lysine intake and two-fold higher arginine intake by LYSx patients were associated with 50% lower plasma lysine, 3-fold lower plasma lysine/arginine concentration ratio, 42% lower mean calculated cerebral lysine influx, 54% higher calculated cerebral arginine influx, 15-26% higher calculated cerebral influx of several anaplerotic precursors (isoleucine, threonine, methionine, and leucine), 50% less 3-hydroxyglutarate excretion, and a 3-fold lower hospitalization rate (0.8 versus 2.3 hospitalizations per patient per year). The relationship between arginine fortification and plasma lysine indicates that transport competition exists at both cerebrovascular and gastrointestinal barriers, suggesting their co-administration is key to efficacy.

4930448,Maternal transfer of the cyanobacterial neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) via milk to suckling offspring,"The cyanobacterial neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative disease and proposed to be biomagnified in terrestrial and aquatic food chains. We have previously shown that the neonatal period in rats, which in humans corresponds to the last trimester of pregnancy and the first few years of age, is a particularly sensitive period for exposure to BMAA. The present study aimed to examine the secretion of (14)C-labeled L- and D-BMAA into milk in lactating mice and the subsequent transfer of BMAA into the developing brain. The results suggest that secretion into milk is an important elimination pathway of BMAA in lactating mothers and an efficient exposure route predominantly for L-BMAA but also for D-BMAA in suckling mice. Following secretion of [(14)C]L-BMAA into milk, the levels of [(14)C]L-BMAA in the brains of the suckling neonatal mice significantly exceeded the levels in the maternal brains. In vitro studies using the mouse mammary epithelial HC11 cell line confirmed a more efficient influx and efflux of L-BMAA than of D-BMAA in cells, suggesting enantiomer-selective transport. Competition experiments with other amino acids and a low sodium dependency of the influx suggests that the amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT2 are involved in the transport of L-BMAA into milk. Given the persistent neurodevelopmental toxicity following injection of L-BMAA to neonatal rodent pups, the current results highlight the need to determine whether BMAA is enriched mother's and cow's milk.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,Yes_LifeStage,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
4863405,Characteristics of L-citrulline transport through blood-brain barrier in the brain capillary endothelial cell line (TR-BBB cells),"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>L-Citrulline is a neutral amino acid and a major precursor of L-arginine in the nitric oxide (NO) cycle. Recently it has been reported that L-citrulline prevents neuronal cell death and protects cerebrovascular injury, therefore, L-citrulline may have a neuroprotective effect to improve cerebrovascular dysfunction. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the brain transport mechanism of L-citrulline through blood-brain barrier (BBB) using the conditionally immortalized rat brain capillary endothelial cell line (TR-BBB cells), as an in vitro model of the BBB.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The uptake study of [14C] L-citrulline, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, and rLAT1, system b0,+, and CAT1 small interfering RNA study were performed in TR-BBB cells.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The uptake of [14C] L-citrulline was a time-dependent, but ion-independent manner in TR-BBB cells. The transport process involved two saturable components with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 30.9 ± 1.0 μM (Km1) and 1.69 ± 0.43 mM (Km2). The uptake of [14C] L-citrulline in TR-BBB cells was significantly inhibited by neutral and cationic amino acids, but not by anionic amino acids. In addition, [14C]L-citrulline uptake in the cells was markedly inhibited by 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), which is the inhibitor of the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), B0, B0,+ and harmaline, the inhibitor of system b0,+. Gabapentin and L-dopa as the substrates of LAT1 competitively inhibited the uptake of [14C] L-citrulline. IC50 values for L-dopa, gabapentin, L-phenylalanine and L-arginine were 501 μM, 223 μM, 68.9 μM and 33.4 mM, respectively. The expression of mRNA for LAT1 was predominantly increased 187-fold in comparison with that of system b0,+ in TR-BBB cells. In the studies of LAT1, system b0,+ and CAT1 knockdown via siRNA transfection into TR-BBB cells, the transcript level of LAT1 and [14C] L-citrulline uptake by LAT1 siRNA were significantly reduced compared with those by control siRNA in TR-BBB cells.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Our results suggest that transport of L-citrulline is mainly mediated by LAT1 in TR-BBB cells. Delivery strategy for LAT1-mediated transport and supply of L-citrulline to the brain may serve as therapeutic approaches to improve its neuroprotective effect in patients with cerebrovascular disease.",t1,Yes_Chemical,Primary,No_LifeStage,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
5091149,Establishment and characterization of an immortalized Z310 choroidal epithelial cell line from murine choroid plexus,"The choroid plexus plays a wide range of roles in brain development, maturation, aging process, endocrine regulation, and pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases. To facilitate in vitro study, we have used a gene transfection technique to immortalize murine choroidal epithelial cells. A viral plasmid (pSV3neo) was inserted into the host genome of primary choroidal epithelia by calcium phosphate precipitation. The transfected epithelial cells, i.e., Z310 cells, that survived from cytotoxic selection expressed SV40 large-T antigen throughout the life span, suggesting a successful gene transfection. The cells displayed the same polygonal epithelial morphology as the starting cells by light microscopy. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrate the presence of transthyretin (TTR), a thyroxine transport protein known to be exclusively produced by the choroidal epithelia in the CNS, in both transfected and starting cells. Western blot analyses further confirm the production and secretion of TTR by these cells. The mRNAs encoding transferrin receptor (TfR) were identified by Northern blot analyses. The cells grow at a steady rate, currently in the 110th passage with a population doubling time of 20-22 h in the established culture. When Z310 cells were cultured onto a Trans-well apparatus, the cells formed an epithelial monolayer similar to primary choroidal cells, possessing features such as an uneven fluid level between inner and outer chambers and an electrical resistance approximately 150-200 omega-cm(2).
